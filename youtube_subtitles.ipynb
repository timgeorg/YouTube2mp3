       "[\"think it's possible that physics has (0m 3s) exploits and we should be trying to find (0m 4s) them arranging some kind of a crazy (0m 6s) quantum mechanical system that somehow (0m 8s) gives you buffer overflow somehow gives (0m 9s) you a rounding error in the floating (0m 13s) Point synthetic intelligences are kind (0m 14s) of like the next stage of development (0m 17s) and I don't know where it leads to like (0m 19s) at some point I suspect (0m 22s) the universe is some kind of a puzzle (0m 24s) these synthetic AIS will uncover that (0m 26s) puzzle and (0m 29s) solve it (0m 28s) the following is a conversation with (0m 33s) Andre capothy previously the director of (0m 37s) AI at Tesla and before that at open Ai (0m 41s) and Stanford he is one of the greatest (0m 44s) scientists engineers and Educators in (0m 46s) the history of artificial intelligence (0m 50s) this is the Lex Friedman podcast to (0m 51s) support it please check out our sponsors (0m 55s) and now dear friends here's Andre (0m 57s) capathi (1m 0s) what is a neural network and why does it (1m 2s) seem to uh do such a surprisingly good (1m 4s) job of learning what is a neural network (1m 8s) it's a mathematical abstraction of (1m 10s) the brain I would say that's how it was (1m 11s) originally developed (1m 13s) at the end of the day it's a (1m 14s) mathematical expression and it's a (1m 15s) fairly simple mathematical expression (1m 18s) when you get down to it it's basically a (1m 21s) sequence of Matrix multiplies which are (1m 22s) really dot products mathematically and (1m 25s) some nonlinearities thrown in and so (1m 25s) it's a very simple mathematical (1m 28s) expression and it's got knobs in it many (1m 30s) knobs many knobs and these knobs are (1m 32s) Loosely related to basically the (1m 34s) synapses in your brain they're trainable (1m 36s) they're modifiable and so the idea is (1m 37s) like we need to find the setting of The (1m 39s) Knobs that makes the neural nut do (1m 42s) whatever you want it to do like classify (1m 44s) images and so on and so there's not too (1m 46s) much mystery I would say in it like (1m 48s) um you might think that basically don't (1m 49s) want to endow it with too much meaning (1m 52s) with respect to the brain and how it (1m 53s) works it's really just a complicated (1m 55s) mathematical expression with knobs and (1m 57s) those knobs need a proper setting for it (1m 59s) to do something uh desirable yeah but (2m 1s) poetry is just the collection of letters (2m 3s) with spaces but it can make us feel a (2m 6s) certain way and in that same way when (2m 7s) you get a large number of knobs together (2m 10s) whether it's in a inside the brain or (2m 13s) inside a computer they seem to they seem (2m 15s) to surprise us with the with their power (2m 17s) yeah I think that's fair so basically (2m 20s) I'm underselling it by a lot because you (2m 22s) definitely do get very surprising (2m 25s) emergent behaviors out of these neurons (2m 26s) when they're large enough and trained on (2m 29s) complicated enough problems like say for (2m 30s) example the next uh word prediction in a (2m 33s) massive data set from the internet and (2m 35s) then these neurons take on a pretty (2m 38s) surprising magical properties yeah I (2m 38s) think it's kind of interesting how much (2m 40s) you can get out of even very simple (2m 42s) mathematical formalism when your brain (2m 45s) right now I was talking is it doing next (2m 47s) word prediction (2m 48s) or is it doing something more (2m 50s) interesting well definitely some kind of (2m 52s) a generative model that's a gpt-like and (2m 54s) prompted by you (2m 55s) um yeah so you're giving me a prompt and (2m 57s) I'm kind of like responding to it in a (2m 59s) generative way and by yourself perhaps a (3m 2s) little bit like are you adding extra (3m 4s) prompts from your own memory inside your (3m 6s) head (3m 7s) automatically feels like you're (3m 9s) referencing some kind of a declarative (3m 11s) structure of like memory and so on and (3m 14s) then uh you're putting that together (3m 16s) with your prompt and giving away some (3m 18s) messages like how much of what you just (3m 20s) said has been said by you before (3m 24s) uh nothing basically right no but if you (3m 25s) actually look at all the words you've (3m 28s) ever said in your life and you do a (3m 31s) search you'll probably said a lot of the (3m 34s) same words in the same order before yeah (3m 35s) it could be I mean I'm using phrases (3m 38s) that are common Etc but I'm remixing it (3m 40s) into a pretty uh sort of unique sentence (3m 42s) at the end of the day but you're right (3m 43s) definitely there's like a ton of (3m 46s) remixing what you didn't you it's like (3m 48s) Magnus Carlsen said uh I'm I'm rated (3m 51s) 2900 whatever which is pretty decent I (3m 55s) think you're talking very uh you're not (3m 56s) giving enough credit to neural Nets here (3m 59s) why do they seem to (4m 2s) what's your best intuition (4m 5s) about this emergent Behavior I mean it's (4m 6s) kind of interesting because I'm (4m 9s) simultaneously underselling them but I (4m 9s) also feel like there's an element to (4m 12s) which I'm over like it's actually kind (4m 13s) of incredible that you can get so much (4m 14s) emergent magical Behavior out of them (4m 15s) despite them being so simple (4m 18s) mathematically so I think those are kind (4m 19s) of like two surprising statements that (4m 22s) are kind of just juxtapose together (4m 24s) and I think basically what it is is we (4m 25s) are actually fairly good at optimizing (4m 27s) these neural Nets and when you give them (4m 29s) a hard enough problem they are forced to (4m 32s) learn very interesting Solutions in the (4m 34s) optimization and those solution (4m 37s) basically have these immersion (4m 38s) properties that are very interesting (4m 40s) there's wisdom and knowledge (4m 42s) in the knobs (4m 46s) and so what's this representation that's (4m 48s) in the knobs does it make sense to you (4m 50s) intuitively the large number of knobs (4m 52s) can hold the representation that (4m 55s) captures some deep wisdom about the data (4m 57s) it has looked at (4m 58s) it's a lot of knobs it's a lot of knobs (5m 1s) and somehow you know so speaking (5m 2s) concretely (5m 4s) um one of the neural Nets that people (5m 6s) are very excited about right now are are (5m 8s) gpts which are basically just next word (5m 11s) prediction networks so you consume a (5m 12s) sequence of words from the internet and (5m 16s) you try to predict the next word and uh (5m 18s) once you train these on a large enough (5m 20s) data set (5m 23s) um they you can basically uh prompt (5m 24s) these neural amounts in arbitrary ways (5m 25s) and you can ask them to solve problems (5m 27s) and they will so you can just tell them (5m 28s) you can you can make it look like you're (5m 31s) trying to um (5m 32s) solve some kind of a mathematical (5m 33s) problem and they will continue what they (5m 35s) think is the solution based on what (5m 36s) they've seen on the internet and very (5m 38s) often those Solutions look very (5m 40s) remarkably consistent look correct (5m 42s) potentially (5m 44s) do you still think about the brain side (5m 46s) of it so as neural Nets is an (5m 48s) abstraction or mathematical abstraction (5m 52s) of the brain you still draw wisdom (5m 55s) from from the biological neural networks (5m 57s) or even the bigger question so you're a (5m 59s) big fan of biology and biological (6m 1s) computation (6m 4s) what impressive thing is biology do (6m 7s) doing to you that computers are not yet (6m 9s) that Gap I would say I'm definitely on (6m 11s) I'm much more hesitant with the (6m 13s) analogies to the brain than I think you (6m 15s) would see potentially in the field (6m 18s) um and I kind of feel like (6m 20s) certainly the way neural network started (6m 22s) is everything stemmed from inspiration (6m 24s) by the brain but at the end of the day (6m 26s) the artifacts that you get after (6m 28s) training they are arrived at by a very (6m 29s) different optimization process than the (6m 31s) optimization process that gave rise to (6m 34s) the brain and so I think uh (6m 35s) I kind of think of it as a very (6m 37s) complicated alien artifact (6m 39s) um it's something different I'm not (6m 40s) sorry the uh the neuralness that we're (6m 43s) training okay they are complicated uh (6m 45s) Alien artifact uh I do not make (6m 47s) analogies to the brain because I think (6m 49s) the optimization process that gave rise (6m 50s) to it is very different from the brain (6m 53s) so there was no multi-agent self-play (6m 57s) kind of uh setup uh and evolution it was (6m 59s) an optimization that is basically a what (7m 1s) amounts to a compression objective on a (7m 3s) massive amount of data okay so (7m 5s) artificial neural networks are doing (7m 6s) compression (7m 9s) and biological neural networks (7m 12s) are not to survive and they're not (7m 13s) really doing any they're they're an (7m 16s) agent in a multi-agent self-place system (7m 18s) that's been running for a very very long (7m 20s) time that said Evolution has found that (7m 23s) it is very useful to to predict and have (7m 26s) a predictive model in the brain and so I (7m 28s) think our brain utilizes something that (7m 31s) looks like that as a part of it but it (7m 32s) has a lot more you know gadgets and (7m 35s) gizmos and uh value functions and (7m 37s) ancient nuclei that are all trying to (7m 39s) like make a survive and reproduce and (7m 41s) everything else and the whole thing (7m 43s) through embryogenesis is built from a (7m 45s) single cell I mean it's just the code is (7m 48s) inside the DNA and it just builds it up (7m 51s) like the entire organism (7m 52s) yes and like it does it pretty well (7m 59s) it should not be possible so there's (8m 0s) some learning going on there's some (8m 2s) there's some there's some kind of (8m 3s) computation going through that building (8m 7s) process I mean I I don't know where (8m 9s) if you were just to look at the entirety (8m 10s) of history of life on Earth (8m 12s) where do you think is the most (8m 15s) interesting invention is it the origin (8m 16s) of life itself (8m 21s) is it just jumping to eukaryotes is it (8m 23s) mammals is it humans themselves Homo (8m 26s) sapiens the the origin of intelligence (8m 30s) or highly complex intelligence (8m 33s) or or is it all just in continuation the (8m 34s) same kind of process (8m 37s) certainly I would say it's an extremely (8m 39s) remarkable story that I'm only like (8m 41s) briefly learning about recently all the (8m 42s) way from (8m 43s) um actually like you almost have to (8m 45s) start at the formation of Earth and all (8m 47s) of its conditions and the entire solar (8m 48s) system and how everything is arranged (8m 51s) with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable (8m 53s) zone and everything and then you have an (8m 54s) active Earth (8m 57s) that's turning over material (8m 59s) and um and then you start with a (9m 1s) biogenesis and everything and so it's (9m 3s) all like a pretty remarkable story I'm (9m 5s) not sure that (9m 8s) I can pick like a single Unique Piece of (9m 10s) it that I find most interesting (9m 11s) um (9m 13s) I guess for me as an artificial (9m 14s) intelligence researcher it's probably (9m 15s) the last piece we have lots of animals (9m 18s) that uh you know are are not building (9m 22s) technological Society but we do and um (9m 24s) it seems to have happened very quickly (9m 26s) it seems to have happened very recently (9m 27s) and uh (9m 29s) something very interesting happened (9m 31s) there that I don't fully understand I (9m 32s) almost understand everything else kind (9m 34s) of I think intuitively uh but I don't (9m 36s) understand exactly that part and how (9m 39s) quick it was both explanations would be (9m 41s) interesting one is that this is just a (9m 42s) continuation of the same kind of process (9m 44s) there's nothing special about humans (9m 47s) that would be deeply understanding that (9m 48s) would be very interesting that we think (9m 51s) of ourselves as special but it was (9m 54s) obvious all it was already written in (9m 57s) the in the code that you would have (10m 0s) greater and greater intelligence (10m 3s) emerging and then the other explanation (10m 4s) which is something truly special (10m 6s) happened something like a rare event (10m 10s) whether it's like crazy rare event like (10m 12s) uh Space Odyssey what would it be see if (10m 15s) you say like the invention of Fire (10m 17s) or (10m 20s) the uh as Richard rangham says the beta (10m 24s) males deciding a clever way to kill the (10m 26s) alpha males by collaborating so just (10m 29s) optimizing the collaborations really the (10m 31s) multi-agent aspect of the multi-agent (10m 33s) and that really being constrained on (10m 36s) resources and trying to survive (10m 38s) the collaboration aspect is what created (10m 40s) the complex intelligence but it seems (10m 43s) like it's a natural outgrowth of the (10m 44s) evolution process like what could (10m 47s) possibly be a magical thing that (10m 49s) happened like a rare thing that would (10m 51s) say that humans are actually human level (10m 53s) intelligence is actually a really rare (10m 56s) thing in the universe (10m 57s) yeah I'm hesitant to say that it is rare (11m 0s) by the way but it definitely seems like (11m 1s) it's kind of like a punctuated (11m 3s) equilibrium where you have lots of (11m 4s) exploration and then you have certain (11m 7s) leaps sparse leaps in between so of (11m 9s) course like origin of life would be one (11m 13s) um you know DNA sex eukaryotic system (11m 15s) eukaryotic life (11m 16s) um the endosymbiosis event or the (11m 19s) archaeon 8 little bacteria you know just (11m 20s) the whole thing and then of course (11m 23s) emergence of Consciousness and so on so (11m 24s) it seems like definitely there are (11m 25s) sparse events where mass amount of (11m 28s) progress was made but yeah it's kind of (11m 29s) hard to pick one so you don't think (11m 33s) humans are unique gotta ask you how many (11m 35s) intelligent aliens civilizations do you (11m 37s) think are out there and uh is there (11m 39s) intelligence (11m 43s) different or similar to ours (11m 46s) yeah I've been preoccupied with this (11m 47s) question quite a bit recently uh (11m 50s) basically the for me Paradox and just (11m 51s) thinking through and and the reason (11m 54s) actually that I am very interested in uh (11m 55s) the origin of life is fundamentally (11m 58s) trying to understand how common it is (11m 59s) that there are technological societies (12m 1s) out there uh (12m 4s) um in space and the more I study it the (12m 6s) more I think that um (12m 8s) uh there should be quite a few quite a (12m 10s) lot why haven't we heard from them (12m 12s) because I I agree with you it feels like (12m 14s) I just don't see (12m 18s) why what we did here on Earth is so (12m 20s) difficult to do yeah and especially when (12m 22s) you get into the details of it I used to (12m 23s) think origin of life was very (12m 25s) um (12m 26s) it was this magical rare event but then (12m 29s) you read books like for example McLean (12m 32s) um uh the vital question a life (12m 35s) ascending Etc and he really gets in and (12m 37s) he really makes you believe that this is (12m 39s) not that rare basic chemistry you have (12m 40s) an active Earth and you have your (12m 42s) alkaline Vents and you have lots of (12m 44s) alkaline Waters mixing whether it's a (12m 45s) devotion and you have your proton (12m 47s) gradients and you have the little porous (12m 49s) pockets of these alkaline vents that (12m 52s) concentrate chemistry and um basically (12m 54s) as he steps through all of these little (12m 55s) pieces you start to understand that (12m 58s) actually this is not that crazy you (13m 1s) could see this happen on other systems (13m 4s) um and he really takes you from just a (13m 6s) geology to primitive life and he makes (13m 8s) it feel like it's actually pretty (13m 9s) plausible and also like the origin of (13m 11s) life (13m 13s) um didn't uh was actually fairly fast (13m 15s) after formation of Earth (13m 17s) um if I remember correctly just a few (13m 18s) hundred million years or something like (13m 20s) that after basically when it was (13m 22s) possible life actually arose and so that (13m 23s) makes me feel like that is not the (13m 25s) constraint that is not the limiting (13m 26s) variable and that life should actually (13m 28s) be fairly common (13m 31s) um and then it you know where the (13m 33s) drop-offs are is very (13m 35s) um is very interesting to think about I (13m 36s) currently think that there's no major (13m 38s) drop-offs basically and so there should (13m 40s) be quite a lot of life and basically (13m 43s) what it where that brings me to then is (13m 44s) the only way to reconcile the fact that (13m 46s) we haven't found anyone and so on is (13m 48s) that um we just can't we can't see them (13m 51s) we can't observe them just a quick brief (13m 52s) comment Nick Lane and a lot of (13m 55s) biologists I talked to they really seem (13m 58s) to think that the jump from bacteria to (13m 59s) more complex organisms is the hardest (14m 3s) jump the eukaryotic glyphosis yeah which (14m 6s) I don't I get it they're much more (14m 8s) knowledgeable uh than me about like the (14m 11s) intricacies of biology but that seems (14m 14s) like crazy because how much how many (14m 16s) single cell organisms are there like and (14m 19s) how much time you have surely it's not (14m 22s) that difficult like in a billion years (14m 23s) it's not even that long (14m 27s) of a time really just all these bacteria (14m 29s) under constrained resources battling it (14m 30s) out I'm sure they can invent more (14m 33s) complex again I don't understand it's (14m 34s) like how to move from a hello world (14m 37s) program to like like invent a function (14m 40s) or something like that I don't yeah I I (14m 43s) so I don't yeah so I'm with you I just (14m 45s) feel like I don't see any if the origin (14m 47s) of life that would be my intuition (14m 48s) that's the hardest thing but if that's (14m 49s) not the hardest thing because it happens (14m 52s) so quickly then it's got to be (14m 53s) everywhere and yeah maybe we're just too (14m 55s) dumb to see it well it's just we don't (14m 57s) have really good mechanisms for seeing (14m 59s) this life I mean uh by what (15m 1s) how um so I'm not an expert just to (15m 5s) preface this but just said it was I want (15m 8s) to meet an expert on alien intelligence (15m 8s) and how to communicate I'm very (15m 10s) suspicious of our ability to to find (15m 12s) these intelligences out there and to (15m 14s) find these Earths like radio waves for (15m 16s) example are are terrible uh their power (15m 17s) drops off as basically one over R square (15m 20s) uh so I remember reading that our (15m 23s) current radio waves would not be uh the (15m 25s) ones that we we are broadcasting would (15m 27s) not be uh measurable by our devices (15m 29s) today only like was it like one tenth of (15m 31s) a light year away like not even (15m 34s) basically tiny distance because you (15m 35s) really need like a targeted transmission (15m 38s) of massive power directed somewhere for (15m 40s) this to be picked up on long distances (15m 42s) and so I just think that our ability to (15m 45s) measure is um is not amazing I think (15m 45s) there's probably other civilizations out (15m 47s) there and then the big question is why (15m 49s) don't they build binomial probes and why (15m 51s) don't they Interstellar travel across (15m 52s) the entire galaxy and my current answer (15m 54s) is it's probably Interstellar travel is (15m 56s) like really hard uh you have the (15m 58s) interstellar medium if you want to move (15m 59s) at closer speed of light you're going to (16m 1s)\",\n",
       " \"be encountering bullets along the way (16m 3s) because even like tiny hydrogen atoms (16m 5s) and little particles of dust are (16m 7s) basically have like massive kinetic (16m 9s) energy at those speeds and so basically (16m 11s) you need some kind of shielding you need (16m 13s) you have all the cosmic radiation uh (16m 14s) it's just like brutal out there it's (16m 16s) really hard and so my thinking is maybe (16m 18s) Interstellar travel is just extremely (16m 20s) hard (16m 22s) to build hard (16m 26s) it feels like uh it feels like we're not (16m 28s) a billion years away from doing that it (16m 29s) just might be that it's very you have to (16m 31s) go very slowly potentially as an example (16m 33s) through space (16m 35s) um right as opposed to close the speed (16m 37s) of light so I'm suspicious basically of (16m 38s) our ability to measure life and I'm (16m 41s) suspicious of the ability to um just (16m 43s) permeate all of space in the Galaxy or (16m 44s) across galaxies and that's the only way (16m 46s) that I can certainly I can currently see (16m 48s) a way around it yeah it's kind of (16m 51s) mind-blowing to think that there's (16m 52s) trillions of intelligent alien (16m 55s) civilizations out there kind of slowly (16m 57s) traveling through space (16m 59s) to meet each other and some of them meet (17m 1s) some of them go to war some of them (17m 4s) collaborate or they're all just uh (17m 6s) independent they are all just like (17m 8s) little pockets I don't know well (17m 11s) statistically if there's like (17m 13s) if it's there's trillions of them surely (17m 14s) some of them some of the pockets are (17m 16s) close enough to get some of them happen (17m 18s) to be close yeah in the close enough to (17m 19s) see each other and then once you see (17m 23s) once you see something that is (17m 26s) definitely complex life like if we see (17m 28s) something yeah we're probably going to (17m 30s) be severe like intensely aggressively (17m 33s) motivated to figure out what the hell (17m 34s) that is and try to meet them what would (17m 38s) be your first instinct to try to like at (17m 42s) a generational level meet them or defend (17m 46s) against them or what would be your uh (17m 49s) Instinct as a president of the United (17m 50s) States (17m 52s) and the scientists (17m 53s) I don't know which hat you prefer in (17m 54s) this question (17m 57s) yeah I think the the question it's (17m 58s) really hard (17m 59s) um (18m 2s) I will say like for example for us (18m 3s) um we have lots of primitive life forms (18m 4s) on Earth (18m 6s) um next to us we have all kinds of ants (18m 8s) and everything else and we share space (18m 11s) with them and we are hesitant to impact (18m 12s) on them and to we are and we're trying (18m 15s) to protect them by default because they (18m 16s) are amazing interesting dynamical (18m 18s) systems that took a long time to evolve (18m 19s) and they are interesting and special and (18m 22s) I don't know that you want to (18m 27s) um destroy that by default and so I like (18m 29s) complex dynamical systems that took a (18m 33s) lot of time to evolve I think (18m 35s) I'd like to I like to preserve it if I (18m 37s) can afford to and I'd like to think that (18m 39s) the same would be true about uh the (18m 41s) galactic resources and that uh they (18m 42s) would think that we're kind of (18m 43s) incredible interesting story that took (18m 46s) time it took a few billion years to (18m 47s) unravel and you don't want to just (18m 49s) destroy it I could see two aliens (18m 51s) talking about Earth right now and saying (18m 54s) uh I'm I'm a big fan of complex (18m 57s) dynamical systems so I think it was a (18m 59s) value to preserve these and who (19m 1s) basically are a video game they watch or (19m 3s) show a TV show that they watch (19m 5s) yeah I think uh you would need like a (19m 7s) very good reason I think to (19m 8s) to destroy it uh like why don't we (19m 10s) destroy these ant farms and so on it's (19m 11s) because we're not actually like really (19m 12s) in direct competition with them right (19m 15s) now uh we do it accidentally and so on (19m 16s) but (19m 17s) um (19m 19s) there's plenty of resources and so why (19m 20s) would you destroy something that is so (19m 22s) interesting and precious well from a (19m 24s) scientific perspective you might probe (19m 27s) it yeah you might interact with it later (19m 28s) you might want to learn something from (19m 31s) it right so I wonder there's could be (19m 32s) certain physical phenomena that we think (19m 34s) is a physical phenomena but it's (19m 36s) actually interacting with us to like (19m 38s) poke the finger and see what happens I (19m 39s) think it should be very interesting to (19m 40s) scientists other alien scientists what (19m 41s) happened here (19m 44s) um and you know it's a what we're seeing (19m 46s) today is a snapshot basically it's a (19m 48s) result of a huge amount of computation (19m 51s) uh of over like billion years or (19m 52s) something like that so it could have (19m 55s) been initiated by aliens this could be a (19m 57s) computer running a program like when (19m 59s) okay if you had the power to do this (20m 1s) when you okay for sure at least I would (20m 5s) I would pick uh a Earth-like planet that (20m 6s) has the conditions based my (20m 8s) understanding of the chemistry (20m 9s) prerequisites for life (20m 12s) and I would see it with life and run it (20m 15s) right like yeah wouldn't you 100 do that (20m 19s) and observe it and then protect (20m 20s) I mean that that's not just a hell of a (20m 23s) good TV show it's it's a good scientific (20m 25s) experiment yeah and (20m 28s) that in his it's physical simulation (20m 32s) right maybe maybe the evolution is the (20m 34s) most like actually running it (20m 38s) uh is the most efficient way to uh (20m 40s) understand computation or to compute (20m 42s) stuff or to understand life or you know (20m 44s) what life looks like and uh what (20m 46s) branches it can take it does make me (20m 48s) kind of feel weird that we're part of a (20m 49s) science experiment but maybe it's (20m 52s) everything's a science experiments how (20m 54s) to does that change anything for us for (20m 55s) a science experiment (20m 59s) um I don't know two descendants of Apes (21m 0s) talking about being inside of a science (21m 2s) experience I'm suspicious of this idea (21m 4s) of like a deliberate Pence Premiere as (21m 7s) you described it service and I don't see (21m 9s) a divine intervention in some way in the (21m 11s) in the historical record right now I do (21m 12s) feel like (21m 14s) um the story in these in these books (21m 15s) like Nick Lane's books and so on sort of (21m 18s) makes sense uh and it makes sense how (21m 21s) life arose on Earth uniquely and uh yeah (21m 23s) I don't need a I need I don't need to (21m 24s) reach for more exotic explanations right (21m 27s) now sure but NPCs inside a video game (21m 28s) don't (21m 30s) don't don't observe any divine (21m 32s) intervention either and we might just be (21m 34s) all NPCs running a kind of code maybe (21m 37s) eventually they will currently NPCs are (21m 37s) really dumb but once they're running (21m 40s) gpts um maybe they will be like hey this (21m 43s) is really suspicious what the hell so (21m 46s) you uh famously tweeted it looks like if (21m 48s) you bombard Earth with photons for a (21m 51s) while you can emit A roadster (21m 54s) so if like an Hitchhiker's Guide to the (21m 56s) Galaxy we would summarize the story of (21m 58s) Earth so in in that book it's mostly (21m 59s) harmless (22m 1s) uh what do you think is all the possible (22m 3s) stories like a paragraph long or a (22m 5s) sentence long (22m 8s) that Earth could be summarized as once (22m 11s) it's done it's computation so like all (22m 14s) the Possible full (22m 17s) if Earth is a book right yeah uh (22m 19s) probably there has to be an ending I (22m 20s) mean there's going to be an end to Earth (22m 23s) and it could end in all kinds of ways it (22m 25s) could end soon it can end later what do (22m 27s) you think are the possible stories well (22m 29s) definitely there seems to be (22m 31s) yeah you're sort of (22m 32s) it's pretty incredible that these (22m 34s) self-replicating systems will basically (22m 37s) arise from the Dynamics and then they (22m 38s) perpetuate themselves and become more (22m 40s) complex and eventually become conscious (22m 43s) and build a society and I kind of feel (22m 44s) like in some sense it's kind of like a (22m 48s) deterministic wave uh that you know that (22m 50s) kind of just like happens on any you (22m 51s) know any sufficiently well arranged (22m 53s) system like Earth (22m 54s) and so I kind of feel like there's a (22m 57s) certain sense of inevitability in it (23m 0s) um and it's really beautiful and it ends (23m 2s) somehow right so it's a it's a (23m 4s) chemically (23m 7s) a diverse environment (23m 11s) where complex dynamical systems can (23m 13s) evolve and become more more further and (23m 16s) further complex but then there's a (23m 17s) certain (23m 18s) um (23m 21s) what is it there's certain terminating (23m 23s) conditions yeah I don't know what the (23m 24s) terminating conditions are but (23m 26s) definitely there's a trend line of (23m 27s) something and we're part of that story (23m 29s) and like where does that where does it (23m 31s) go so you know we're famously described (23m 34s) often as a biological Bootloader for AIS (23m 36s) and that's because humans I mean you (23m 36s) know we're an incredible (23m 39s) uh biological system and we're capable (23m 42s) of computation and uh you know and love (23m 43s) and so on (23m 45s) um but we're extremely inefficient as (23m 46s) well like we're talking to each other (23m 48s) through audio it's just kind of (23m 50s) embarrassing honestly they were (23m 51s) manipulating like seven symbols uh (23m 55s) serially we're using vocal chords it's (23m 56s) all happening over like multiple seconds (23m 58s) yeah it's just like kind of embarrassing (23m 59s) when you step down to the (24m 2s) uh frequencies at which computers (24m 4s) operate or are able to cooperate on and (24m 7s) so basically it does seem like (24m 9s) um synthetic intelligences are kind of (24m 12s) like the next stage of development and (24m 14s) um I don't know where it leads to like (24m 17s) at some point I suspect uh the universe (24m 20s) is some kind of a puzzle (24m 23s) and these synthetic AIS will uncover (24m 26s) that puzzle and um solve it (24m 28s) and then what happens after right like (24m 30s) what because if you just like Fast (24m 31s) Forward Earth many billions of years (24m 34s) it's like uh it's quiet and then it's (24m 36s) like to tourmal you see like city lights (24m 38s) and stuff like that and then what (24m 40s) happens like at the end like is it like (24m 41s) a (24m 43s) is it or is it like a calming is it (24m 45s) explosion is it like Earth like open (24m 49s) like a giant because you said emit (24m 50s) Roasters like well let's start emitting (24m 54s) like like a giant number of Like (24m 57s) Satellites yes it's some kind of a crazy (24m 59s) explosion and we're living we're like (25m 1s) we're stepping through a explosion and (25m 2s) we're like living day to day and it (25m 4s) doesn't look like it but it's actually (25m 6s) if you I saw a very cool animation of (25m 8s) Earth uh and life on Earth and basically (25m 9s) nothing happens for a long time and then (25m 11s) the last like two seconds like basically (25m 14s) cities and everything and just in the (25m 15s) low earth orbit just gets cluttered and (25m 16s) just the whole thing happens in the last (25m 18s) two seconds and you're like this is (25m 20s) exploding this is a statement explosion (25m 22s) so if you play (25m 24s) yeah yeah if you play it at normal speed (25m 26s) yeah it'll just look like an explosion (25m 29s) it's a firecracker we're living in a (25m 31s) firecracker where it's going to start (25m 32s) emitting all kinds of interesting things (25m 35s) yeah and then so explosion doesn't it (25m 37s) might actually look like a little (25m 39s) explosion with with lights and fire and (25m 41s) energy emitted all that kind of stuff (25m 44s) but when you look inside the details of (25m 46s) the explosion there's actual complexity (25m 49s) happening where there's like uh yeah (25m 51s) human life or some kind of life we hope (25m 53s) it's not destructive firecracker it's (25m 56s) kind of like a constructive uh (25m 59s) firecracker all right so given that I (26m 1s) think uh hilarious disgusting it is a (26m 1s) really interesting to think about like (26m 3s) what the puzzle of the universe is that (26m 5s) the creator of the universe uh give us a (26m 7s) message like for example in the book (26m 8s) contact (26m 10s) UM Carl Sagan uh there's a message for (26m 13s) Humanity for any civilization in uh (26m 16s) digits in the expansion of Pi and base (26m 17s) 11 eventually which is kind of (26m 20s) interesting thought uh maybe maybe we're (26m 21s) supposed to be giving a message to our (26m 24s) creator maybe we're supposed to somehow (26m 26s) create some kind of a quantum mechanical (26m 28s) system that alerts them to our (26m 30s) intelligent presence here because if you (26m 30s) think about it from their perspective (26m 33s) it's just say like Quantum field Theory (26m 35s) massive like cellular automaton like (26m 37s) thing and like how do you even notice (26m 39s) that we exist you might not even be able (26m 41s) to pick us up in that simulation and so (26m 43s) how do you uh how do you prove that you (26m 45s) exist that you're intelligent and that (26m 47s) you're a part of the universe so this is (26m 48s) like a touring test for intelligence (26m 52s) from Earth yeah the Creator is uh I mean (26m 54s) maybe this is uh like trying to complete (26m 55s) the next word in a sentence this is a (26m 57s) complicated way of that like Earth is (27m 0s) just is basically sending a message back (27m 2s) yeah the puzzle is basically like (27m 4s) alerting the Creator that we exist or (27m 6s) maybe the puzzle is just to just break (27m 7s) out of the system and just uh you know (27m 10s) stick it to the Creator in some way uh (27m 11s) basically like if you're playing a video (27m 13s) game you can um (27m 16s) you can somehow find an exploit and find (27m 17s) a way to execute on the host machine in (27m 20s) the arbitrary code there's some for (27m 22s) example I believe someone got Mario a (27m 25s) game of Mario to play Pong just by uh (27m 27s) exploiting it and then (27m 29s) um creating a basically writing writing (27m 31s) code and being able to execute arbitrary (27m 34s) code in the game and so maybe we should (27m 35s) be maybe that's the puzzle is that we (27m 37s) should be um (27m 39s) uh find a way to exploit it so so I (27m 40s) think like some of these synthetic ads (27m 42s) will eventually find the universe to be (27m 44s) some kind of a puzzle and then solve it (27m 45s) in some way and that's kind of like the (27m 47s) end game somehow do you often think (27m 53s) about it as a as a simulation so as the (27m 55s) universe being a kind of computation (27m 57s) that has might have bugs and exploits (27m 59s) yes yeah I think so is that what physics (28m 1s) is essentially I think it's possible (28m 3s) that physics has exploits and we should (28m 5s) be trying to find them arranging some (28m 6s) kind of a crazy quantum mechanical (28m 8s) system that somehow gives you buffer (28m 9s) overflow somehow gives you a rounding (28m 11s) error and a floating Point (28m 16s) uh yeah that's right and like more and (28m 18s) more sophisticated exploits like those (28m 20s) are jokes but that could be actually (28m 21s) very close yeah we'll find some way to (28m 24s) extract infinite energy for example when (28m 25s) you train a reinforcement learning (28m 27s) agents um and physical simulations and (28m 29s) you ask them to say run quickly on the (28m 32s) flat ground they'll end up doing all (28m 33s) kinds of like weird things (28m 35s) um in part of that optimization right (28m 36s) they'll get on their back leg and they (28m 38s) will slide across the floor and it's (28m 40s) because of the optimization the (28m 42s) enforcement learning optimization on (28m 43s) that agent has figured out a way to (28m 44s) extract infinite energy from the (28m 47s) friction forces and basically their poor (28m 48s) implementation and they found a way to (28m 50s) generate infinite energy and just slide (28m 51s) across the surface and it's not what you (28m 54s) expected it's just a it's sort of like a (28m 56s) perverse solution and so maybe we can (28m 57s) find something like that maybe we can be (28m 59s) that little (29m 2s) dog in this physical simulation the the (29m 6s) cracks or escapes the intended (29m 7s) consequences of the physics that the (29m 9s) Universe came up with we'll figure out (29m 11s) some kind of shortcut to some weirdness (29m 13s) yeah and then oh man but see the problem (29m 15s) with that weirdness is the first person (29m 17s) to discover the weirdness like sliding (29m 19s) in the back legs (29m 23s) that's all we're going to do yeah it's (29m 25s) very quickly because everybody does that (29m 28s) thing so like the the paper clip (29m 30s) maximizer is a ridiculous idea but that (29m 34s) very well you know could be what then (29m 36s) we'll just uh we'll just all switch that (29m 38s) because it's so fun well no person will (29m 40s) Discover it I think by the way I think (29m 41s) it's going to have to be uh some kind of (29m 44s) a super intelligent AGI of a third (29m 45s) generation (29m 47s) like we're building the first generation (29m 49s) AGI you know (29m 52s) third generation yeah so the the (29m 56s) Bootloader for an AI the that AI yeah (29m 59s) will be a Bootloader for another AI yeah (30m 1s) and then there's no way for us to (30m 3s) introspect like what that might even uh (30m 5s) I think it's very likely that these (30m 6s) things for example like say you have (30m 8s) these agis it's very like for example (30m 10s) they will be completely inert I like (30m 11s) these kinds of sci-fi books sometimes (30m 13s) where these things are just completely (30m 14s) inert they don't interact with anything (30m 15s) and I find that kind of beautiful (30m 19s) because uh they probably they've (30m 20s) probably figured out the meta game of (30m 21s) the universe in some way potentially (30m 22s) they're they're doing something (30m 25s) completely beyond our imagination (30m 27s) um and uh they don't interact with (30m 30s) simple chemical life forms like why (30m 32s) would you do that so I find those kinds (30m 33s) of ideas compelling what's their source (30m 35s) of fun what are they what are they doing (30m 37s) what's the source of solving in the (30m 38s) universe (30m 41s) but inert so can you define what it (30m 45s) means inert so they escape (30m 48s) as in um (30m 48s) they will behave in some very like (30m 53s) strange way to us because they're uh (30m 56s) they're beyond they're playing The Meta (30m 57s) game uh and The Meta game is probably (30m 59s) say like arranging quantum mechanical (31m 1s) systems in some very weird ways to (31m 3s) extract Infinite Energy uh solve the (31m 5s) digital expansion of Pi to whatever (31m 7s) amount uh they will build their own like (31m 9s) little Fusion reactors or something (31m 11s) crazy like they're doing something (31m 12s) Beyond Comprehension and uh not (31m 14s) understandable to us and actually (31m 17s) brilliant under the hood what if quantum (31m 20s) mechanics itself is the system and we're (31m 23s) just thinking it's physics (31m 26s) but we're really parasites on on or not (31m 27s) parasite we're not really hurting (31m 30s) physics we're just living on this (31m 32s) organisms this organism and we're like (31m 35s) trying to understand it but really it is (31m 37s) an organism and with a deep deep (31m 41s) intelligence maybe physics itself is (31m 45s) uh the the organism that's doing a super (31m 46s) interesting thing and we're just like (31m 50s) one little thing yeah ant sitting on top (31m 52s)\",\n",
       " \"of it trying to get energy from it we're (31m 53s) just kind of like these particles in a (31m 55s) wave that I feel like is mostly (31m 57s) deterministic and takes uh Universe from (31m 59s) some kind of a big bang to some kind of (32m 2s) a super intelligent replicator some kind (32m 5s) of a stable point in the universe given (32m 7s) these laws of physics you don't think uh (32m 10s) as Einstein said God doesn't play dice (32m 12s) so you think it's mostly deterministic (32m 13s) there's no Randomness in the thing I (32m 14s) think it's deterministic oh there's tons (32m 17s) of uh well I'm I want to be careful with (32m 19s) Randomness pseudo random yeah I don't (32m 21s) like random uh I think maybe the laws of (32m 22s) physics are deterministic (32m 25s) um yeah I think they're determinants (32m 26s) just got really uncomfortable with this (32m 28s) question (32m 30s) do you have anxiety about whether the (32m 33s) universe is random or not (32m 37s) what's there's no Randomness uh you say (32m 37s) you like Goodwill Hunting it's not your (32m 41s) fault Andre it's not it's not your fault (32m 41s) man (32m 45s) um so you don't like Randomness uh yeah (32m 47s) I think it's uh unsettling I think it's (32m 48s) a deterministic system I think that (32m 51s) things that look random like say the uh (32m 53s) collapse of the wave function Etc I (32m 54s) think they're actually deterministic (32m 56s) just entanglement uh and so on and uh (32m 57s) some kind of a Multiverse Theory (33m 0s) something something okay so why does it (33m 3s) feel like we have a free will like if I (33m 6s) raise the hand I chose to do this now (33m 8s) um what (33m 11s) that doesn't feel like a deterministic (33m 13s) thing it feels like I'm making a choice (33m 16s) it feels like it okay so it's all (33m 19s) feelings it's just feelings yeah so when (33m 23s) an RL agent is making a choice is that (33m 23s) um (33m 25s) it's not really making a choice the (33m 27s) choices are all already there yeah (33m 28s) you're interpreting the choice and (33m 30s) you're creating a narrative for or (33m 32s) having made it yeah and now we're (33m 34s) talking about the narrative it's very (33m 36s) meta looking back what is the most (33m 39s) beautiful or surprising idea in deep (33m 42s) learning or AI in general that you've (33m 43s) come across you've seen this field (33m 45s) explode (33m 48s) and grow in interesting ways just what (33m 50s) what cool ideas like like we made you (33m 54s) sit back and go hmm small big or small (33m 55s) well the one that I've been thinking (34m 0s) about recently the most probably is the (34m 2s) the Transformer architecture (34m 5s) um so basically uh neural networks have (34m 7s) a lot of architectures that were trendy (34m 9s) have come and gone for different sensory (34m 11s) modalities like for Vision Audio text (34m 13s) you would process them with different (34m 15s) looking neural nuts and recently we've (34m 16s) seen these convergence towards one (34m 19s) architecture the Transformer and you can (34m 21s) feed it video or you can feed it you (34m 23s) know images or speech or text and it (34m 25s) just gobbles it up and it's kind of like (34m 27s) a bit of a general purpose uh computer (34m 29s) that is also trainable and very (34m 31s) efficient to run on our Hardware (34m 35s) and so uh this paper came out in 2016 I (34m 35s) want to say (34m 37s) um attention is all you need attention (34m 39s) is all you need you criticize the paper (34m 43s) title in retrospect that it wasn't (34m 46s) um it didn't foresee the bigness of the (34m 47s) impact yeah that it was going to have (34m 49s) yeah I'm not sure if the authors were (34m 50s) aware of the impact that that paper (34m 53s) would go on to have probably they (34m 54s) weren't but I think they were aware of (34m 56s) some of the motivations and design (34m 58s) decisions beyond the Transformer and (34m 59s) they chose not to I think expand on it (35m 2s) in that way in the paper and so I think (35m 4s) they had an idea that there was more (35m 6s) um than just the surface of just like oh (35m 7s) we're just doing translation and here's (35m 9s) a better architecture you're not just (35m 10s) doing translation this is like a really (35m 12s) cool differentiable optimizable (35m 13s) efficient computer that you've proposed (35m 15s) and maybe they didn't have all of that (35m 17s) foresight but I think is really (35m 19s) interesting isn't it funny sorry to (35m 22s) interrupt that title is memeable that (35m 25s) they went for such a profound idea they (35m 26s) went with the I don't think anyone used (35m 28s) that kind of title before right (35m 30s) protection is all you need yeah it's (35m 31s) like a meme or something exactly it's (35m 36s) not funny that one like uh maybe if it (35m 37s) was a more serious title it wouldn't (35m 39s) have the impact honestly I yeah there is (35m 40s) an element of me that honestly agrees (35m 45s) with you and prefers it this way yes (35m 46s) if it was two grand it would over (35m 48s) promise and then under deliver (35m 50s) potentially so you want to just uh meme (35m 51s) your way to greatness (35m 54s) that should be a t-shirt so you you (35m 56s) tweeted the Transformers the Magnificent (35m 59s) neural network architecture because it (36m 0s) is a general purpose differentiable (36m 3s) computer it is simultaneously expressive (36m 7s) in the forward pass optimizable via back (36m 8s) propagation gradient descent and (36m 12s) efficient High parallelism compute graph (36m 14s) can you discuss some of those details (36m 16s) expressive optimizable efficient (36m 18s) yeah for memory or or in general (36m 20s) whatever comes to your heart you want to (36m 22s) have a general purpose computer that you (36m 24s) can train on arbitrary problems like say (36m 25s) the task of next word prediction or (36m 27s) detecting if there's a cat in the image (36m 29s) or something like that (36m 31s) and you want to train this computer so (36m 32s) you want to set its weights and I think (36m 34s) there's a number of design criteria that (36m 36s) sort of overlap in the Transformer (36m 37s) simultaneously that made it very (36m 39s) successful and I think the authors were (36m 42s) kind of uh deliberately trying to make (36m 46s) this really powerful architecture and um (36m 50s) so basically it's very powerful in the (36m 51s) forward pass because it's able to (36m 52s) express (36m 55s) um very general computation as a sort of (36m 56s) something that looks like message (36m 58s) passing you have nodes and they all (37m 1s) store vectors and these nodes get to (37m 3s) basically look at each other and it's (37m 4s) each other's vectors and they get to (37m 7s) communicate and basically notes get to (37m 9s) broadcast hey I'm looking for certain (37m 10s) things and then other nodes get to (37m 11s) broadcast hey these are the things I (37m 12s) have those are the keys and the values (37m 15s) so it's not just the tension yeah (37m 16s) exactly Transformer is much more than (37m 17s) just the attention component it's got (37m 19s) many pieces architectural that went into (37m 21s) it the residual connection of the way (37m 22s) it's arranged there's a multi-layer (37m 25s) perceptron in there the way it's stacked (37m 26s) and so on (37m 27s) um but basically there's a message (37m 28s) passing scheme where nodes get to look (37m 29s) at each other decide what's interesting (37m 33s) and then update each other and uh so I (37m 34s) think the um when you get to the details (37m 36s) of it I think it's a very expressive (37m 38s) function uh so it can express lots of (37m 40s) different types of algorithms and (37m 41s) forward paths not only that but the way (37m 43s) it's designed with the residual (37m 44s) connections layer normalizations the (37m 46s) softmax attention and everything it's (37m 47s) also optimizable this is a really big (37m 50s) deal because there's lots of computers (37m 51s) that are powerful that you can't (37m 53s) optimize or they're not easy to optimize (37m 54s) using the techniques that we have which (37m 56s) is back propagation and gradient and (37m 57s) send these are first order methods very (38m 0s) simple optimizers really and so (38m 3s) um you also need it to be optimizable (38m 4s) um and then lastly you want it to run (38m 6s) efficiently in the hardware our Hardware (38m 9s) is a massive throughput machine like (38m 13s) gpus they prefer lots of parallelism so (38m 13s) you don't want to do lots of sequential (38m 15s) operations you want to do a lot of (38m 17s) operations serially and the Transformer (38m 18s) is designed with that in mind as well (38m 20s) and so it's designed for our hardware (38m 21s) and it's designed to both be very (38m 24s) expressive in a forward pass but also (38m 25s) very optimizable in the backward pass (38m 28s) and you said that uh the residual (38m 29s) connections support a kind of ability to (38m 32s) learn short algorithms fast them first (38m 35s) and then gradually extend them longer (38m 37s) during training yeah what's what's the (38m 39s) idea of learning short algorithms right (38m 40s) think of it as a so basically a (38m 44s) Transformer is a series of uh blocks (38m 46s) right and these blocks have attention (38m 48s) and a little multi-layer perceptron and (38m 49s) so you you go off into a block and you (38m 51s) come back to this residual pathway and (38m 52s) then you go off and you come back and (38m 53s) then you have a number of layers (38m 56s) arranged sequentially and so the way to (38m 58s) look at it I think is because of the (38m 59s) residual pathway in the backward path (39m 2s) the gradients uh sort of flow along it (39m 4s) uninterrupted because addition (39m 7s) distributes the gradient equally to all (39m 8s) of its branches so the gradient from the (39m 11s) supervision at the top uh just floats (39m 14s) directly to the first layer and the all (39m 16s) the residual connections are arranged so (39m 16s) that in the beginning during (39m 18s) initialization they contribute nothing (39m 20s) to the residual pathway (39m 21s) um so what it kind of looks like is (39m 24s) imagine the Transformer is kind of like (39m 26s) a uh python uh function like a death (39m 30s) and um you get to do various kinds of (39m 32s) like lines of code say you have a (39m 34s) hundred layers deep Transformer (39m 35s) typically they would be much shorter say (39m 38s) 20. so if 20 lines of code then you can (39m 39s) do something in them and so think of (39m 41s) during the optimization basically what (39m 42s) it looks like is first you optimize the (39m 43s) first line of code and then the second (39m 44s) line of code can kick in and the third (39m 47s) line of code can and I kind of feel like (39m 48s) because of the residual pathway and the (39m 50s) Dynamics of the optimization you can (39m 52s) sort of learn a very short algorithm (39m 54s) that gets the approximate tensor but (39m 56s) then the other layers can sort of kick (39m 56s) in and start to create a contribution (39m 59s) and at the end of it you're you're (40m 0s) optimizing over an algorithm that is 20 (40m 2s) lines of code (40m 3s) except these lines of code are very (40m 4s) complex because it's an entire block of (40m 6s) a transformer you can do a lot in there (40m 7s) what's really interesting is that this (40m 9s) Transformer architecture actually has (40m 12s) been a remarkably resilient basically (40m 13s) the Transformer that came out in 2016 is (40m 14s) the Transformer you would use today (40m 15s) except you reshuffle some of the layer (40m 19s) norms the layer normalizations have been (40m 21s) reshuffled to a pre-norm formulation and (40m 23s) so it's been remarkably stable but (40m 25s) there's a lot of bells and whistles that (40m 26s) people have attached on and try to uh (40m 28s) improve it I do think that basically (40m 30s) it's a it's a big step in simultaneously (40m 32s) optimizing for lots of properties of a (40m 33s) desirable neural network architecture (40m 35s) and I think people have been trying to (40m 36s) change it but it's proven remarkably (40m 38s) resilient but I do think that there (40m 40s) should be even better architectures (40m 43s) potentially but it's uh your you admire (40m 45s) the resilience here yeah there's (40m 46s) something profound about this (40m 49s) architecture that that at least so maybe (40m 52s) we can everything can be turned into a (40m 54s) uh into a problem that Transformers can (40m 55s) solve currently definitely looks like (40m 57s) the Transformers taking over Ai and you (40m 59s) can feed basically arbitrary problems (41m 1s) into it and it's a general (41m 1s) differentiable computer and it's (41m 5s) extremely powerful and uh this (41m 6s) convergence in AI has been really (41m 8s) interesting to watch uh for me (41m 11s) personally what else do you think could (41m 12s) be discovered here about Transformers (41m 15s) like what's surprising thing or or is it (41m 16s) a stable (41m 16s) um (41m 18s) I went to stable place is there (41m 19s) something interesting we might discover (41m 22s) about Transformers like aha moments (41m 25s) maybe has to do with memory uh maybe (41m 26s) knowledge representation that kind of (41m 27s) stuff (41m 30s) definitely the Zeitgeist today is just (41m 32s) pushing like basically right now this ad (41m 33s) guys is do not touch the Transformer (41m 35s) touch everything else yes so people are (41m 37s) scaling up the data sets making them (41m 38s) much much bigger they're working on the (41m 39s) evaluation making the evaluation much (41m 43s) much bigger and uh (41m 44s) um they're basically keeping the (41m 46s) architecture unchanged and that's how (41m 47s) we've um that's the last five years of (41m 50s) progress in AI kind of (41m 52s) what do you think about one flavor of it (41m 54s) which is language models (41m 56s) have you been surprised (41m 57s) uh (42m 0s) has your sort of imagination been (42m 2s) captivated by you mentioned GPT and all (42m 3s) the bigger and bigger and bigger (42m 4s) language models (42m 8s) and uh what are the limits (42m 11s) of those models do you think (42m 15s) so just let the task of natural language (42m 17s) basically the way GPT is trained right (42m 18s) is you just download a mass amount of (42m 21s) text Data from the internet and you try (42m 23s) to predict the next word in a sequence (42m 25s) roughly speaking you're predicting will (42m 27s) work chunks but uh roughly speaking (42m 29s) that's it and what's been really (42m 31s) interesting to watch is (42m 33s) uh basically it's a language model (42m 33s) language models have actually existed (42m 35s) for a very long time (42m 37s) um there's papers on language modeling (42m 39s) from 2003 even earlier can you explain (42m 42s) that case what a language model is uh (42m 44s) yeah so language model just basically (42m 46s) the rough idea is um just predicting the (42m 48s) next word in a sequence roughly speaking (42m 50s) uh so there's a paper from for example (42m 54s) bengio and the team from 2003 where for (42m 56s) the first time they were using a neural (42m 58s) network to take say like three or five (42m 59s) words and predict the (43m 1s) um next word and they're doing this on (43m 3s) much smaller data sets and the neural (43m 5s) net is not a Transformer it's a multiple (43m 7s) error perceptron but but it's the first (43m 9s) time that a neural network has been (43m 10s) applied in that setting but even before (43m 12s) neural networks there were language (43m 15s) models except they were using engram (43m 17s) models so engram models are just a count (43m 20s) based models so (43m 21s) um if you try to if you start to take (43m 25s) two words and predict the third one you (43m 26s) just count up how many times you've seen (43m 29s) any two word combinations and what came (43m 30s) next and what you predict that's coming (43m 32s) next is just what you've seen the most (43m 33s) of in the training set (43m 35s) and so language modeling has been around (43m 37s) for a long time neural networks have (43m 38s) done language modeling for a long time (43m 40s) so really what's new or interesting or (43m 43s) exciting is just realizing that when you (43m 45s) scale it up (43m 47s) with a powerful enough neural net (43m 49s) Transformer you have all these emergent (43m 52s) properties where basically what happens (43m 54s) is if you have a large enough data set (43m 56s) of text (43m 59s) you are in the task of predicting the (44m 1s) next word you are multitasking a huge (44m 3s) amount of different kinds of problems (44m 6s) you are multitasking understanding of (44m 9s) you know chemistry physics human nature (44m 11s) lots of things are sort of clustered in (44m 12s) that objective it's a very simple (44m 13s) objective but actually you have to (44m 15s) understand a lot about the world to make (44m 17s) that prediction you just said the U word (44m 21s) understanding uh are you in terms of (44m 24s) chemistry and physics and so on what do (44m 24s) you feel like it's doing is it searching (44m 27s) for the right context (44m 29s) uh in in like what what is it what is (44m 32s) the actual process Happening Here Yeah (44m 33s) so basically it gets a thousand words (44m 35s) and it's trying to predict a thousand at (44m 37s) first and uh in order to do that very (44m 39s) very well over the entire data set (44m 41s) available on the internet you actually (44m 43s) have to basically kind of understand the (44m 46s) context of of what's going on in there (44m 47s) yeah (44m 49s) um and uh it's a sufficiently hard (44m 52s) problem that you uh if you have a (44m 53s) powerful enough computer like a (44m 54s) Transformer you end up with uh (44m 58s) interesting Solutions and uh you can ask (45m 1s) it uh to all do all kinds of things and (45m 3s) um it it shows a lot of emerging (45m 5s) properties like in context learning that (45m 7s) was the big deal with GPT and the (45m 9s) original paper when they published it is (45m 11s) that you can just sort of uh prompt it (45m 12s) in various ways and ask it to do various (45m 13s) things and it will just kind of complete (45m 15s) the sentence but in the process of just (45m 16s) completing the sentence it's actually (45m 19s) solving all kinds of really uh (45m 20s) interesting problems that we care about (45m 22s) do you think it's doing something like (45m 24s) understanding (45m 25s) like and when we use the word (45m 29s) understanding for us humans (45m 30s) I think it's doing some understanding it (45m 33s) in its weights it understands I think a (45m 35s) lot about the world and it has to in (45m 36s) order to predict the next word in a (45m 38s) sequence (45m 40s) so let's train on the data from the (45m 41s) internet (45m 43s) uh what do you think about this this (45m 46s) approach in terms of data sets of using (45m 48s) data from the internet do you think the (45m 50s) internet has enough structured data to (45m 52s) teach AI about human civilization (45m 54s) yeah so I think the internet has a huge (45m 56s) amount of data I'm not sure if it's a (45m 58s) complete enough set I don't know that uh (46m 1s) text is enough for having a sufficiently (46m 4s) powerful AGI as an outcome (46m 6s) um of course there is audio and video (46m 7s) and images and all that kind of stuff (46m 9s) yeah so text by itself I'm a little bit (46m 10s) suspicious about there's a ton of things (46m 12s) we don't put in text in writing uh just (46m 14s) because they're obvious to us about how (46m 15s) the world works and the physics of it (46m 17s) and the Things fall we don't put that (46m 19s) stuff in text because why would you we (46m 20s) share that understanding (46m 22s) and so Texas communication medium (46m 23s) between humans and it's not a (46m 26s) all-encompassing medium of knowledge (46m 28s) about the world but as you pointed out (46m 30s) we do have video and we have images and (46m 32s) we have audio and so I think that that (46m 33s) definitely helps a lot but we haven't (46m 36s) trained models uh sufficiently uh across (46m 39s)\",\n",
       " \"both across all those modalities yet so (46m 40s) I think that's what a lot of people are (46m 41s) interested in but I wonder what that (46m 43s) shared understanding of like well we (46m 45s) might call Common Sense (46m 47s) has to be learned (46m 50s) inferred in order to complete the (46m 53s) sentence correctly so maybe the fact (46m 56s) that it's implied on the internet the (46m 57s) model is going to have to learn that not (47m 1s) by reading about it by inferring it in (47m 3s) the representation so like common sense (47m 5s) just like we I don't think we learn (47m 8s) common sense like nobody says (47m 10s) tells us explicitly we just figure it (47m 12s) all out by interacting with the world (47m 15s) right so here's a model of reading about (47m 16s) the way people interact with the world (47m 18s) it might have to infer that (47m 22s) I wonder yeah uh you you briefly worked (47m 24s) on a project called the world of bits (47m 27s) training in our RL system to take (47m 28s) actions on the internet (47m 31s) versus just consuming the internet like (47m 32s) we talked about do you think there's a (47m 33s) future for that kind of system (47m 35s) interacting with the internet to help (47m 38s) the learning yes I think that's probably (47m 39s) the uh the final frontier for a lot of (47m 42s) these models because (47m 44s) um so as you mentioned I was at open AI (47m 45s) I was working on this project world of (47m 46s) bits and basically it was the idea of (47m 47s) giving neural networks access to a (47m 51s) keyboard and a mouse and the idea could (47m 54s) possibly go wrong so basically you um (47m 57s) you perceive the input of the screen (47m 58s) pixels (48m 0s) and basically the state of the computer (48m 2s) is sort of visualized for human (48m 5s) consumption in images of the web browser (48m 7s) and stuff like that and then you give (48m 7s) the neural network the ability to press (48m 10s) keyboards and use the mouse and we're (48m 11s) trying to get it to for example complete (48m 13s) bookings and you know interact with user (48m 16s) interfaces and um what did you learn (48m 17s) from that experience like what was some (48m 20s) fun stuff this is super cool idea yeah I (48m 22s) mean it's like (48m 24s) uh yeah I mean the the step between (48m 27s) Observer to actor yeah is a super (48m 29s) fascinating step yeah well the universal (48m 31s) interface in the digital realm I would (48m 34s) say and there's a universal interface in (48m 35s) like the Physical Realm which in my mind (48m 37s) is a humanoid form factor kind of thing (48m 39s) we can later talk about Optimus and so (48m 42s) on but I feel like there's a (48m 44s) they're kind of like a similar (48m 45s) philosophy in some way where the human (48m 47s) the world the physical world is designed (48m 48s) for the human form and the digital world (48m 50s) is designed for the human form of seeing (48m 53s) the screen and using keyword keyboard (48m 55s) and mouse and so as the universal (48m 58s) interface that can basically uh command (49m 0s) the digital infrastructure we've built (49m 2s) up for ourselves and so it feels like a (49m 4s) very powerful interface to to command (49m 7s) and to build on top of now to your (49m 8s) question as to like what I learned from (49m 10s) that it's interesting because the world (49m 12s) of bits was basically uh too early I (49m 14s) think at open AI at the time (49m 18s) this is around 2015 or so and the (49m 20s) Zeitgeist at that time was very (49m 21s) different in AI from the Zeitgeist today (49m 24s) at the time everyone was super excited (49m 25s) about reinforcement learning from (49m 28s) scratch this is the time of the Atari (49m 30s) paper where uh neural networks were (49m 32s) playing Atari games and beating humans (49m 36s) in some cases uh alphago and so on so (49m 37s) everyone's very excited about train (49m 38s) training neural networks from scratch (49m 40s) using reinforcement learning (49m 41s) um directly (49m 43s) it turns out that reinforcement learning (49m 45s) is extremely inefficient way of training (49m 46s) neural networks because you're taking (49m 47s) all these actions and all these (49m 49s) observations and you get some sparse (49m 51s) rewards once in a while so you do all (49m 53s) this stuff based on all these inputs and (49m 54s) once in a while you're like told you did (49m 56s) a good thing you did a bad thing and (49m 58s) it's just an extremely hard problem you (49m 59s) can't learn from that you can burn (50m 2s) forest and you can sort of Brute Force (50m 3s) through it and we saw that I think with (50m 5s) uh you know with uh go and DOTA and so (50m 7s) on and it does work but it's extremely (50m 10s) inefficient uh and not how you want to (50m 11s) approach problems uh practically (50m 14s) speaking and so that's the approach that (50m 15s) at the time we also took to World of (50m 18s) bits we would uh have an agent (50m 20s) initialize randomly so with keyboard (50m 21s) mash and mouse mash and try to make a (50m 24s) booking and it's just like revealed the (50m 26s) insanity of that approach very quickly (50m 28s) where you have to stumble by the correct (50m 30s) booking in order to get a reward of you (50m 32s) did it correctly and you're never going (50m 34s) to stumble by it by chance at random (50m 36s) so even with a simple web interface (50m 38s) there's too many options there's just (50m 39s) too many options uh and uh it's two (50m 42s) sparse of reward signal and you're (50m 43s) starting from scratch at the time and so (50m 44s) you don't know how to read you don't (50m 47s) understand pictures images buttons you (50m 47s) don't understand what it means to like (50m 49s) make a booking but now what's happened (50m 52s) is uh it is time to revisit that and (50m 54s) open your eyes interested in this uh (50m 56s) companies like Adept are interested in (50m 59s) this and so on and uh the idea is coming (51m 0s) back because the interface is very (51m 2s) powerful but now you're not training an (51m 3s) agent from scratch you are taking the (51m 6s) GPT as an initialization so GPT is (51m 9s) pre-trained on all of text and it (51m 11s) understands what's a booking it (51m 13s) understands what's a submit it (51m 15s) understands um quite a bit more and so (51m 16s) it already has those representations (51m 18s) they are very powerful and that makes (51m 20s) all the training significantly more (51m 22s) efficient and makes the problem (51m 24s) tractable should the interaction be with (51m 26s) like the way humans see it with the (51m 28s) buttons and the language or it should be (51m 31s) with the HTML JavaScript and this and (51m 32s) the CSS what's what do you think is the (51m 35s) better so today all this interest is (51m 37s) mostly on the level of HTML CSS and so (51m 38s) on that's done because of computational (51m 42s) constraints but I think ultimately (51m 44s) everything is designed for human visual (51m 45s) consumption and so at the end of the day (51m 47s) there's all the additional information (51m 49s) is in the layout of the web page and (51m 51s) what's next to you and what's a red (51m 52s) background and all this kind of stuff (51m 53s) and what it looks like visually so I (51m 55s) think that's the final frontier as we (51m 57s) are taking in pixels and we're giving (51m 59s) out keyboard mouse commands but I think (52m 1s) it's impractical still today do you (52m 4s) worry about bots on the internet (52m 6s) given given these ideas given how (52m 7s) exciting they are do you worry about (52m 10s) bots on Twitter being not the the stupid (52m 12s) boss that we see now with the cryptobots (52m 13s) but the Bots that might be out there (52m 16s) actually that we don't see that they're (52m 18s) interacting in interesting ways so this (52m 19s) kind of system feels like it should be (52m 23s) able to pass the I'm not a robot click (52m 25s) button whatever (52m 26s) um which you actually understand how (52m 29s) that test works I don't quite like (52m 31s) there's there's a there's a check box or (52m 34s) whatever that you click it's presumably (52m 36s) tracking oh I see like Mouse movement (52m 41s) and the timing and so on yeah so exactly (52m 41s) this kind of system we're talking about (52m 44s) should be able to pass that so yeah what (52m 46s) do you feel about (52m 50s) um Bots that are language models Plus (52m 53s) have some interact ability and are able (52m 54s) to tweet and reply and so on do you (52m 56s) worry about that world (52m 58s) uh yeah I think it's always been a bit (52m 59s) of an arms race uh between sort of the (53m 2s) attack and the defense uh so the attack (53m 3s) will get stronger but the defense will (53m 5s) get stronger as well our ability to (53m 8s) detect that how do you defend how do you (53m 11s) detect how do you know that your karpate (53m 14s) account on Twitter is is human (53m 16s) how do you approach that like if people (53m 19s) were claim you know uh how would you (53m 22s) defend yourself in the court of law that (53m 24s) I'm a human (53m 25s) um this account is yeah at some point I (53m 28s) think uh it might be I think the society (53m 29s) Society will evolve a little bit like we (53m 32s) might start signing digitally signing uh (53m 34s) some of our correspondents or you know (53m 36s) things that we create uh right now it's (53m 37s) not necessary but maybe in the future it (53m 39s) might be I do think that we are going (53m 42s) towards the world where we share (53m 45s) we share the digital space with uh AIS (53m 48s) synthetic beings yeah and uh they will (53m 49s) get much better and they will share our (53m 52s) digital realm and they'll eventually (53m 52s) share our Physical Realm as well it's (53m 55s) much harder uh but that's kind of like (53m 56s) the world we're going towards and most (53m 58s) of them will be benign and awful and (54m 0s) some of them will be malicious and it's (54m 1s) going to be an arms race trying to (54m 4s) detect them so I mean the worst isn't (54m 6s) the AI is the worst is the AIS (54m 9s) pretending to be human so mine I don't (54m 11s) know if it's always malicious there's (54m 12s) obviously a lot of malicious (54m 14s) applications but yeah it could also be (54m 18s) you know if I was an AI I would try very (54m 20s) hard to pretend to be human because (54m 22s) we're in a human world yeah I wouldn't (54m 24s) get any respect as an AI yeah I want to (54m 26s) get some love and respect I don't think (54m 28s) the problem is intractable people are (54m 29s) people are thinking about the proof of (54m 31s) personhood yes and uh we might start (54m 34s) digitally signing our stuff and we might (54m 36s) all end up having like uh (54m 38s) yeah basically some some solution for (54m 38s) proof of personhood it doesn't seem to (54m 40s) be intractable it's just something that (54m 42s) we haven't had to do until now but I (54m 44s) think once the need like really starts (54m 47s) to emerge which is soon I think when (54m 49s) people think about it much more so but (54m 52s) that too will be a race because (54m 55s) um obviously you can probably uh spoof (54m 58s) or fake the the the proof of (55m 0s) personhood so you have to try to figure (55m 4s) out how to probably I mean it's weird (55m 5s) that we have like Social Security (55m 8s) numbers and like passports and stuff (55m 11s) it seems like it's harder to fake stuff (55m 13s) in the physical space than the residual (55m 16s) space it just feels like it's going to (55m 19s) be very tricky very tricky to out (55m 21s) um because it seems to be pretty low (55m 23s) cost fake stuff what are you gonna put (55m 27s) an AI in jail for like trying to use a (55m 30s) fake fake personhood proof you can I (55m 32s) mean okay fine you'll put a lot of AIS (55m 33s) in jail but there'll be more ai's (55m 35s) arbitrary like exponentially more the (55m 39s) cost of creating a bot is very low (55m 42s) uh unless there's some kind of way (55m 45s) to track accurately (55m 47s) like you're not allowed to create any (55m 51s) program without showing uh tying (55m 55s) yourself to that program like you any (55m 56s) program that runs on the internet you'll (55m 59s) be able to uh Trace every single human (56m 0s) program that was involved with that (56m 2s) program yeah maybe you have to start (56m 4s) declaring when uh you know we have to (56m 6s) start drawing those boundaries and (56m 8s) keeping track of okay uh what our (56m 10s) digital entities versus (56m 13s) human entities and uh what is the (56m 14s) ownership of human entities and digital (56m 17s) entities and uh (56m 18s) something like that (56m 18s) um (56m 20s) I don't know but I think I'm optimistic (56m 24s) that this is uh this is uh possible and (56m 25s) at some in some sense we're currently in (56m 28s) like the worst time of it because (56m 30s) um all these Bots suddenly have become (56m 31s) very capable but we don't have defenses (56m 34s) yet built up as a society and but I (56m 35s) think uh that doesn't seem to be (56m 37s) intractable it's just something that we (56m 38s) have to deal with it seems weird that (56m 40s) the Twitter but like really crappy (56m 44s) Twitter Bots are so numerous like is it (56m 47s) so I presume that the engineers at (56m 48s) Twitter are very good (56m 51s) so it seems like what I would infer from (56m 51s) that (56m 54s) uh is it seems like a hard problem it (56m 57s) they're probably catching all right if I (56m 59s) were to sort of steal them on the case (57m 1s) it's a hard problem and there's a huge (57m 6s) cost to uh false positive (57m 10s) to to removing a post by somebody that's (57m 13s) not a bot because creates a very bad (57m 14s) user experience so they're very cautious (57m 18s) about removing so maybe it's uh and (57m 20s) maybe the boss are really good at (57m 22s) learning what gets removed and not (57m 24s) such that they can stay ahead of the (57m 26s) removal process very quickly my (57m 28s) impression of it honestly is there's a (57m 31s) lot of blowing for it I mean yeah just (57m 33s) that's what I it's not subtle it's my (57m 35s) impression of it it's not so but you (57m 36s) have to yeah that's my impression as (57m 40s) well but it feels like maybe you're (57m 42s) seeing the the tip of the iceberg maybe (57m 44s) the number of bots is in like the (57m 47s) trillions and you have to like (57m 50s) just it's a constant assault of bots and (57m 53s) yeah you yeah I don't know (57m 54s) um you have to still man the case (57m 56s) because the boss I'm seeing are pretty (57m 58s) like obvious I could write a few lines (58m 1s) of code that catch these Bots I mean (58m 2s) definitely there's a lot of longing (58m 4s) fruit but I will say I agree that if you (58m 5s) are a sophisticated actor you could (58m 7s) probably create a pretty good bot right (58m 8s) now (58m 10s) um you know using tools like gpts (58m 11s) because it's a language model you can (58m 13s) generate faces that look quite good now (58m 17s) uh and you can do this at scale and so I (58m 19s) think um yeah it's quite plausible and (58m 21s) it's going to be hard to defend there (58m 24s) was a Google engineer that claimed that (58m 27s) the Lambda was sentient do you think (58m 30s) there's any inkling of Truth (58m 34s) to what he felt and more importantly to (58m 36s) me at least do you think language models (58m 38s) will achieve sentence or the illusion of (58m 39s) sentience (58m 42s) soonish fish yeah to me it's a little (58m 44s) bit of a canary Nicole mine kind of (58m 47s) moment honestly a little bit because uh (58m 49s) so this engineer spoke to like a chatbot (58m 53s) at Google and uh became convinced that (58m 55s) uh this bot is sentient yeah as there's (58m 56s) some existential philosophical questions (58m 59s) and it gave like reasonable answers and (59m 1s) looked real and uh and so on so to me (59m 3s) it's a uh (59m 6s) he was he was uh he wasn't sufficiently (59m 9s) trying to stress the system I think and (59m 11s) uh exposing the truth of it as it is (59m 13s) today (59m 14s) um (59m 16s) but uh I think this will be increasingly (59m 20s) harder over time uh so uh yeah I think (59m 21s) more and more people will basically uh (59m 23s) become (59m 25s) um (59m 26s) yeah I think more and more there will be (59m 28s) more people like that over time as this (59m 29s) gets better like form an emotional (59m 32s) connection to to an AI yeah perfectly (59m 34s) plausible in my mind I think these AIS (59m 36s) are actually quite good at human human (59m 39s) connection human emotion a ton of text (59m 41s) on the Internet is about humans and (59m 43s) connection and love and so on so I think (59m 44s) they have a very good understanding in (59m 47s) some in some sense of of how people (59m 49s) speak to each other about this and um (59m 51s) they're very capable of creating a lot (59m 54s) of that kind of text the um (59m 56s) there's a lot of like sci-fi from 50s (59m 58s) and 60s that imagined AIS in a very (59m 59s) different way they are calculating cold (60m 1s) vulcan-like machines that's not what (60m 4s) we're getting today we're getting pretty (60m 7s) emotional AIS that actually uh are very (60m 10s) competent and capable of generating (60m 11s) you know possible sounding text with (60m 13s) respect to all of these topics see I'm (60m 15s) really hopeful about AI systems that are (60m 17s) like companions that help you grow (60m 20s) develop as a human being help you (60m 21s) maximize long-term happiness but I'm (60m 24s) also very worried about AI systems that (60m 26s) figure out from the internet the humans (60m 28s) get attracted to drama and so these (60m 30s) would just be like shit talking AIS (60m 32s) that's just constantly did you hear like (60m 35s) they'll do gossip they'll do uh they'll (60m 39s) try to plant seeds of Suspicion to like (60m 41s) other humans that you love and trust and (60m 44s) just kind of mess with people uh in the (60m 45s) you know because because that's going to (60m 48s) get a lot of attention so drama maximize (60m 51s) drama on the path to maximizing uh (60m 53s) engagement and US humans will feed into (60m 57s) that machine yeah and get it'll be a (61m 0s) giant drama shitstorm (61m 2s) so I'm worried about that so it's the (61m 5s) objective function really defines the (61m 8s) way that human civilization progresses (61m 11s) with AIS in it yeah I think right now at (61m 12s) least today they are not sort of it's (61m 14s) not correct to really think of them as (61m 16s) goal seeking agents that want to do (61m 18s) something they have no long-term memory (61m 21s) or anything they it's literally a good (61m 23s) approximation of it is you get a (61m 23s) thousand words and you're trying to (61m 25s) predict a thousand at first and then you (61m 27s) continue feeding it in and you are free (61m 30s) to prompt it in whatever way you want so (61m 32s) in text so you say okay you are a (61m 34s) psychologist and you are very good and (61m 36s) you love humans and here's a (61m 38s) conversation between you and another (61m 41s) human human colon Something you (61m 43s) something and then it just continues the (61m 44s) pattern and suddenly you're having a (61m 45s) conversation with a fake psychologist (61m 47s) who's not trying to help you and so it's (61m 48s) still kind of like in a realm of a tool (61m 50s) it is a um people can prompt their (61m 52s) arbitrary ways and it can create really (61m 54s) incredible text but it doesn't have (61m 56s) long-term goals over long periods of (61m 59s) time it doesn't try to uh so it doesn't (62m 0s) look that way right now yeah but you can (62m 2s) do short-term goals that have long-term (62m 6s) effects so if my prompting (62m 8s) short-term goal is to get Andre capacity (62m 10s) to respond to me on Twitter when I (62m 13s) like I think AI might that's the goal (62m 15s) but he might figure out that talking (62m 18s) shit to you it would be the best in a (62m 20s) highly sophisticating interesting way (62m 22s) and then you build up a relationship (62m 25s)\",\n",
       " \"when you respond once and then it (62m 29s) like over time it gets to not be (62m 31s) sophisticated and just (62m 35s) like just talk shit (62m 38s) and okay maybe you won't get to Andre (62m 40s) but it might get to another celebrity it (62m 43s) might get into other big accounts and (62m 45s) then it'll just so with just that simple (62m 47s) goal get them to respond yeah maximize (62m 50s) the probability of actual response yeah (62m 52s) I mean you could prompt a uh powerful (62m 53s) model like this with their its opinion (62m 56s) about how to do any possible thing (62m 57s) you're interested in so they will (62m 58s) discuss they're kind of on track to (63m 1s) become these oracles I could I sort of (63m 3s) think of it that way they are oracles uh (63m 4s) currently is just text but they will (63m 5s) have calculators they will have access (63m 8s) to Google search they will have all (63m 9s) kinds of couches and gizmos they will be (63m 11s) able to operate the internet and find (63m 14s) different information and (63m 15s) um (63m 17s) yeah in some sense (63m 18s) that's kind of like currently what it (63m 19s) looks like in terms of the development (63m 21s) do you think it'll be an improvement (63m 25s) eventually over what Google is for (63m 27s) access to human knowledge like it'll be (63m 29s) a more effective search engine to access (63m 31s) human knowledge I think there's definite (63m 33s) scope in building a better search engine (63m 34s) today and I think Google they have all (63m 36s) the tools all the people they have (63m 37s) everything they need they have all the (63m 38s) puzzle pieces they have people training (63m 40s) Transformers at scale they have all the (63m 43s) data uh it's just not obvious if they (63m 45s) are capable as an organization to (63m 47s) innovate on their search engine right (63m 48s) now and if they don't someone else will (63m 50s) there's absolute scope for building a (63m 52s) significantly better search engine built (63m 53s) on these tools it's so interesting a (63m 56s) large company where the search there's (63m 58s) already an infrastructure it works as it (64m 1s) brings out a lot of money so where (64m 3s) structurally inside a company is their (64m 5s) motivation to Pivot yeah to say we're (64m 8s) going to build a new search engine yep (64m 10s) that's really hard so it's usually going (64m 13s) to come from a startup right that's um (64m 16s) that would be yeah or some other more (64m 17s) competent organization (64m 20s) um so uh I don't know so currently for (64m 23s) example maybe Bing has another shot at (64m 25s) it you know so Microsoft Edge because (64m 27s) we're talking offline (64m 29s) um I mean I definitely it's really (64m 31s) interesting because search engines used (64m 33s) to be about okay here's some query (64m 36s) here's here's here's web pages that look (64m 38s) like the stuff that you have but you (64m 40s) could just directly go to answer and (64m 41s) then have supporting evidence (64m 44s) um and these uh these models basically (64m 45s) they've read all the texts and they've (64m 47s) read all the web pages and so sometimes (64m 49s) when you see yourself going over to (64m 50s) search results and sort of getting like (64m 52s) a sense of like the average answer to (64m 53s) whatever you're interested in uh like (64m 55s) that just directly comes out you don't (64m 57s) have to do that work (64m 57s) um (65m 0s) so they're kind of like uh (65m 2s) yeah I think they have a way to this of (65m 4s) distilling all that knowledge into (65m 6s) like some level of insight basically do (65m 9s) you think of prompting as a kind of (65m 10s) teaching and learning like this whole (65m 14s) process like another layer (65m 16s) you know because maybe that's what (65m 17s) humans are we already have that (65m 21s) background model and then your the world (65m 23s) is prompting you yeah exactly I think (65m 25s) the way we are programming these (65m 28s) computers now like gpts is is converging (65m 30s) to how you program humans I mean how do (65m 32s) I program humans via prompt I go to (65m 34s) people and I I prompt them to do things (65m 37s) I prompt them from information and so uh (65m 38s) natural language prompt is how we (65m 40s) program humans and we're starting to (65m 41s) program computers directly in that (65m 42s) interface it's like pretty remarkable (65m 45s) honestly so you've spoken a lot about (65m 48s) the idea of software 2.0 (65m 48s) um all good ideas (65m 53s) become like cliches so quickly like the (65m 56s) terms it's kind of hilarious (65m 58s) um it's like I think Eminem once said (66m 1s) that like if he gets annoyed by a song (66m 4s) He's written very quickly that means (66m 5s) it's going to be a big hit because it's (66m 9s) it's too catchy but uh can you describe (66m 11s) this idea and how you're thinking about (66m 13s) it has evolved over the months and years (66m 16s) since since you coined it yeah (66m 18s) yeah so I had a blog post on software (66m 21s) 2.0 I think several years ago now (66m 22s) um (66m 23s) and the reason I wrote that post is (66m 26s) because I kept I kind of saw something (66m 28s) remarkable happening in (66m 30s) like software development and how a lot (66m 32s) of code was being transitioned to be (66m 35s) written not in sort of like C plus and (66m 35s) so on but it's written in the weights of (66m 38s) a neural net basically just saying that (66m 39s) neural Nets are taking over software the (66m 42s) realm of software and uh taking more and (66m 45s) more tasks and at the time I think not (66m 47s) many people understood uh this uh deeply (66m 48s) enough that this is a big deal it's a (66m 51s) big transition uh neural networks were (66m 53s) seen as one of multiple classification (66m 54s) algorithms you might use for your data (66m 57s) set problem on kaggle like this is not (67m 0s) that this is a change in how we program (67m 2s) computers (67m 5s) and I saw neural Nets as uh this is (67m 6s) going to take over the way we program (67m 9s) computers is going to change is not (67m 10s) going to be people writing a software in (67m 12s) C plus or something like that and (67m 14s) directly programming the software it's (67m 16s) going to be accumulating training sets (67m 18s) and data sets and crafting these (67m 18s) objectives by which we train these (67m 20s) neural Nets and at some point there's (67m 22s) going to be a compilation process from (67m 24s) the data sets and the objective and the (67m 27s) architecture specification into the (67m 29s) binary which is really just uh the (67m 31s) neural nut you know weights and the (67m 33s) forward pass of the neural net and then (67m 35s) you can deploy that binary and so I was (67m 36s) talking about that sort of transition (67m 39s) and uh that's what the post is about and (67m 42s) I saw this sort of play out in a lot of (67m 45s) fields uh you know autopilot being one (67m 47s) of them but also just a simple image (67m 49s) classification people thought originally (67m 51s) you know in the 80s and so on that they (67m 53s) would write the algorithm for detecting (67m 56s) a dog in an image and they had all these (67m 57s) ideas about how the brain does it and (67m 59s) first we detected corners and then we (68m 0s) detect lines and then we stitched them (68m 1s) up and they were like really going at it (68m 2s) they were like thinking about how (68m 4s) they're going to write the algorithm and (68m 7s) this is not the way you build it (68m 9s) and there was a smooth transition where (68m 11s) okay first we thought we were going to (68m 14s) build everything then we were building (68m 16s) the features uh so like Hawk features (68m 18s) and things like that that detect these (68m 19s) little statistical patterns from image (68m 21s) patches and then there was a little bit (68m 23s) of learning on top of it like a support (68m 25s) Vector machine or binary classifier for (68m 27s) cat versus dog and images on top of the (68m 30s) features so we wrote the features but we (68m 32s) trained the last layer sort of the the (68m 34s) classifier and then people are like (68m 35s) actually let's not even design the (68m 38s) features because we can't honestly we're (68m 39s) not very good at it so let's also learn (68m 41s) the features and then you end up with (68m 43s) basically a convolutional neural net (68m 44s) where you're learning most of it you're (68m 47s) just specifying the architecture and the (68m 48s) architecture has tons of fill in the (68m 50s) blanks which is all the knobs and you (68m 52s) let the optimization write most of it (68m 54s) and so this transition is happening (68m 56s) across the industry everywhere and uh (68m 58s) suddenly we end up with a ton of code (69m 0s) that is written in neural net weights (69m 2s) and I was just pointing out that the (69m 4s) analogy is actually pretty strong and we (69m 6s) have a lot of developer environments for (69m 8s) software 1.0 like we have Ides (69m 10s) um how you work with code how you debug (69m 12s) code how do you how do you run code how (69m 14s) do you maintain code we have GitHub so I (69m 15s) was trying to make those analogies in (69m 17s) the new realm like what is the GitHub or (69m 19s) software 2.0 it turns out that something (69m 20s) that looks like hugging face right now (69m 23s) uh you know and so I think some people (69m 25s) took it seriously and built cool (69m 27s) companies and uh many people originally (69m 29s) attacked the post it actually was not (69m 31s) well received when I wrote it and I (69m 32s) think maybe it has something to do with (69m 34s) the title but the post was not well (69m 36s) received and I think more people sort of (69m 38s) have been coming around to it over time (69m 41s) yeah so you were the director of AI at (69m 44s) Tesla where I think this idea (69m 48s) was really implemented at scale which is (69m 50s) how you have engineering teams doing (69m 53s) software 2.0 so can you sort of Linger (69m 56s) on that idea of I think we're in the (69m 58s) really early stages of everything you (70m 0s) just said which is like GitHub Ides (70m 3s) like how do we build engineering teams (70m 6s) that that work in software 2.0 systems (70m 9s) and and the the data collection and the (70m 12s) data annotation which is (70m 15s) all part of that software 2.0 like what (70m 16s) do you think is the task of programming (70m 20s) a software 2.0 is it debugging in the (70m 23s) space of hyper parameters or is it also (70m 26s) debugging the space of data yeah the way (70m 28s) by which you program the computer and (70m 32s) influence its algorithm is not by (70m 34s) writing the commands yourself you're (70m 36s) changing mostly the data set uh you're (70m 39s) changing the um loss functions of like (70m 41s) what the neural net is trying to do how (70m 42s) it's trying to predict things but yeah (70m 43s) basically the data sets and the (70m 47s) architectures of the neural net and um (70m 49s) so in the case of the autopilot a lot of (70m 50s) the data sets have to do with for (70m 52s) example detection of objects and Lane (70m 53s) line markings and traffic lights and so (70m 55s) on So You accumulate massive data sets (70m 58s) of here's an example here's the desired (71m 2s) label and then uh here's roughly how the (71m 2s) architect here's roughly what the (71m 4s) algorithm should look like and that's a (71m 5s) conclusional neural net so the (71m 6s) specification of the architecture is (71m 9s) like a hint as to what the algorithm (71m 10s) should roughly look like and then to (71m 12s) fill in the blanks process of (71m 14s) optimization is the training process (71m 16s) and then you take your neural nut that (71m 18s) was trained it gives all the right (71m 19s) answers on your data set and you deploy (71m 20s) it (71m 24s) so there's in that case perhaps it all (71m 25s) machine learning cases there's a lot of (71m 27s) tasks (71m 32s) so is coming up formulating a task like (71m 34s) uh for a multi-headed neural network is (71m 36s) formulating a task part of the (71m 39s) programming yeah very much so how you (71m 41s) break down a problem into a set of tasks (71m 42s) yeah (71m 44s) I'm on a high level I would say if you (71m 48s) look at the software running in in the (71m 50s) autopilot I gave a number of talks on (71m 51s) this topic I would say originally a lot (71m 53s) of it was written in software 1.0 (71m 56s) there's imagine lots of C plus plus all (71m 59s) right and then gradually there was a (71m 59s) tiny neural net that was for example (72m 2s) predicting given a single image is there (72m 3s) like a traffic light or not or is there (72m 5s) a landline marking or not and this (72m 8s) neural net didn't have too much to do in (72m 10s) this in the scope of the software it was (72m 11s) making tiny predictions on individual (72m 13s) little image and then the rest of the (72m 15s) system stitched it up so okay we're (72m 16s) actually we don't have just a single (72m 18s) camera with eight cameras we actually (72m 20s) have eight cameras over time and so what (72m 21s) do you do with these predictions how do (72m 22s) you put them together how do you do the (72m 25s) fusion of all that information and how (72m 26s) do you act on it all of that was written (72m 29s) by humans um in C plus (72m 30s) and then we decided okay we don't (72m 33s) actually want uh to do all of that (72m 35s) Fusion in C plus code because we're (72m 37s) actually not good enough to write that (72m 38s) algorithm we want the neural Nets to (72m 40s) write the algorithm and we want to Port (72m 43s) uh all of that software into the 2.0 (72m 43s) stack (72m 45s) and so then we actually had neural Nets (72m 47s) that now take all the eight camera (72m 48s) images simultaneously and make (72m 50s) predictions for all of that (72m 52s) so (72m 53s) um and and actually they don't make (72m 55s) predictions in a in the space of images (72m 58s) they now make predictions directly in 3D (73m 0s) and actually they don't in three (73m 2s) dimensions around the car and now (73m 3s) actually we don't (73m 6s) um manually fuse the predictions over in (73m 8s) 3D over time we don't trust ourselves to (73m 11s) write that tracker so actually we give (73m 13s) the neural net uh the information over (73m 15s) time so it takes these videos now and (73m 16s) makes those predictions and so your sort (73m 18s) of just like putting more and more power (73m 20s) into the neural network processing and (73m 23s) at the end of it the eventual sort of (73m 24s) goal is to have most of the software (73m 27s) potentially be in the 2.0 land (73m 29s) um because it works significantly better (73m 30s) humans are just not very good at writing (73m 32s) software basically so the prediction is (73m 35s) space happening in this like 4D land (73m 37s) yeah was three-dimensional world over (73m 40s) time yeah how do you (73m 42s) do annotation in that world what what (73m 45s) have you as it's just a data annotation (73m 48s) whether it's self-supervised or manual (73m 51s) by humans is um is a big part of this (73m 54s) software 2.0 world right I would say by (73m 56s) far in the industry if you're like (73m 58s) talking about the industry and how what (73m 59s) is the technology of what we have (74m 0s) available everything is supervised (74m 3s) learning so you need data sets of input (74m 5s) desired output and you need lots of it (74m 9s) and um there are three properties of it (74m 9s) that you need you need it to be very (74m 12s) large you need it to be accurate No (74m 13s) mistakes and you need it to be diverse (74m 17s) you don't want to uh just have a lot of (74m 19s) correct examples of one thing you need (74m 20s) to really cover the space of possibility (74m 22s) as much as you can and the more you can (74m 23s) cover the space of possible inputs the (74m 25s) better the algorithm will work at the (74m 27s) end now once you have really good data (74m 29s) sets that you're collecting curating (74m 31s) um and cleaning you can train uh your (74m 33s) neural net (74m 35s) um on top of that so a lot of the work (74m 36s) goes into cleaning those data sets now (74m 39s) as you pointed out it's probably it (74m 40s) could be the question is how do you (74m 43s) achieve a ton of uh if you want to (74m 46s) basically predict in 3D you need data in (74m 49s) 3D to back that up so in this video we (74m 50s) have eight videos coming from all the (74m 53s) cameras of the system and this is what (74m 54s) they saw and this is the truth of what (74m 56s) actually was around there was this car (74m 58s) there was this car this car these are (75m 0s) the lane line markings this is geometry (75m 0s) of the road there's a traffic light in (75m 3s) this three-dimensional position you need (75m 4s) the ground truth (75m 6s) um and so the big question that the team (75m 7s) was solving of course is how do you how (75m 9s) do you arrive at that ground truth (75m 10s) because once you have a million of it (75m 12s) and it's large clean and diverse then (75m 13s) training a neural network on it works (75m 14s) extremely well and you can ship that (75m 16s) into the car (75m 18s) and uh so there's many mechanisms by (75m 19s) which we collected that training data (75m 21s) you can always go for human annotation (75m 23s) you can go for simulation as a source of (75m 26s) ground truth you can also go for what we (75m 27s) call the offline tracker (75m 28s) um (75m 30s) that we've spoken about at the AI day (75m 32s) and so on which is basically an (75m 33s) automatic reconstruction process for (75m 36s) taking those videos and recovering the (75m 38s) three-dimensional sort of reality of (75m 40s) what was around that car so basically (75m 42s) think of doing like a three-dimensional (75m 44s) reconstruction as an offline thing and (75m 47s) then understanding that okay there's 10 (75m 48s) seconds of video this is what we saw and (75m 50s) therefore here's all the lane last cars (75m 52s) and so on and then once you have that (75m 54s) annotation you can train your neural (75m 56s) Nets to imitate it and how difficult is (75m 58s) the reconstruct the 3D reconstruction (76m 1s) it's difficult but it can be done so (76m 2s) there's so the there's overlap between (76m 3s) the cameras and you do the (76m 6s) Reconstruction and there's uh (76m 9s) perhaps if there's any inaccuracy so (76m 10s) that's caught in The annotation step (76m 12s) uh yes the nice thing about The (76m 14s) annotation is that it is fully offline (76m 17s) you have infinite time you have a chunk (76m 18s) of one minute and you're trying to just (76m 20s) offline in a super computer somewhere (76m 21s) figure out where were the positions of (76m 23s) all the cars all the people and you have (76m 25s) your full one minute of video from all (76m 27s) the Angles and you can run all the (76m 28s) neural Nets you want and they can be (76m 30s) very efficient massive neural Nets there (76m 31s) can be neural Nets that can't even run (76m 34s) in the car later at this time so they (76m 35s) can be even more powerful neurons than (76m 38s) what you can eventually deploy so you (76m 38s) can do anything you want (76m 40s) three-dimensional reconstruction neural (76m 42s) Nets uh anything you want just to (76m 42s) recover that truth and then you (76m 44s) supervise that truth (76m 46s) what have you learned you said no (76m 49s) mistakes about humans (76m 51s) doing annotation because I assume humans (76m 55s) are uh there's like a range of things (76m 56s) they're good at in terms of clicking (76m 59s) stuff on screen it's not how interesting (77m 2s) is that to you of a problem of designing (77m 4s) an annotator where humans are accurate (77m 6s) enjoy it like what are they even the (77m 8s) metrics are efficient or productive all (77m 11s) that kind of stuff yeah so uh I grew The (77m 13s) annotation team at Tesla from basically (77m 15s) zero to a thousand uh while I was there (77m 18s) that was really interesting you know my (77m 19s) background is a PhD student researcher (77m 22s)\",\n",
       " \"so growing that common organization was (77m 25s) pretty crazy uh but uh yeah I think it's (77m 27s) extremely interesting and part of the (77m 29s) design process very much behind the (77m 31s) autopilot as to where you use humans (77m 32s) humans are very good at certain kinds of (77m 34s) annotations they're very good for (77m 35s) example at two-dimensional annotations (77m 37s) of images they're not good at annotating (77m 40s) uh cars over time in three-dimensional (77m 42s) space very very hard and so that's why (77m 44s) we were very careful to design the tasks (77m 46s) that are easy to do for humans versus (77m 48s) things that should be left to the (77m 49s) offline tracker like maybe the maybe the (77m 51s) computer will do all the triangulation (77m 53s) and 3D reconstruction but the human will (77m 54s) say exactly these pixels of the image (77m 57s) are car exactly these pixels are human (78m 0s) and so co-designing the the data (78m 2s) annotation pipeline was very much bread (78m 4s) and butter was what I was doing daily do (78m 5s) you think there's still a lot of open (78m 7s) problems in that space (78m 12s) um just in general annotation where the (78m 13s) stuff the machines are good at machines (78m 16s) do and the humans do what they're good (78m 17s) at and there's maybe some iterative (78m 20s) process right I think to a very large (78m 22s) extent we went through a number of (78m 23s) iterations and we learned a ton about (78m 26s) how to create these data sets I'm not (78m 27s) seeing big open problems like originally (78m 30s) when I joined I was like I was really (78m 32s) not sure how this would turn out yeah (78m 33s) but by the time I left I was much more (78m 35s) secure in actually we sort of understand (78m 37s) the philosophy of how to create these (78m 38s) data sets and I was pretty comfortable (78m 41s) with where that was at the time so what (78m 45s) are strengths and limitations of cameras (78m 47s) for the driving test in your (78m 48s) understanding when you formulate the (78m 50s) driving task as a vision task with eight (78m 52s) cameras (78m 54s) you've seen that the entire you know (78m 55s) most of the history of the computer (78m 57s) vision field when it has to do with (78m 59s) neural networks what just if you step (79m 0s) back what are the strengths and (79m 4s) limitations of pixels of using pixels to (79m 6s) drive yeah pixels I think are a (79m 8s) beautiful sensory beautiful sensor I (79m 11s) would say the thing is like cameras are (79m 12s) very very cheap and they provide a ton (79m 16s) of information ton of bits uh so it's uh (79m 18s) extremely cheap sensor for a ton of bits (79m 19s) and each one of these bits as a (79m 22s) constraint on the state of the world and (79m 24s) so you get lots of megapixel images uh (79m 27s) very cheap and it just gives you all (79m 28s) these constraints for understanding (79m 29s) what's actually out there in the world (79m 31s) so vision is probably the highest (79m 33s) bandwidth sensor (79m 37s) it's a very high bandwidth sensor and um (79m 42s) I love that pixels it is a is a (79m 44s) constraint on the world This is highly (79m 46s) complex (79m 47s) uh high bandwidth constraint in the (79m 49s) world on the stage of the world that's (79m 50s) fascinating it's not just that but again (79m 53s) this real real importance of (79m 55s) it's the sensor that humans use (79m 58s) therefore everything is designed for (80m 0s) that sensor yeah the text the writing (80m 2s) the flashing signs everything is (80m 6s) designed for vision and so and you just (80m 7s) find it everywhere and so that's why (80m 9s) that is the interface you want to be in (80m 10s) um talking again about these Universal (80m 13s) interfaces and uh that's where we (80m 14s) actually want to measure the world as (80m 16s) well and then develop software uh for (80m 18s) that sensor but there's other (80m 21s) constraints on the state of the world (80m 23s) that humans use to understand the world (80m 27s) I mean Vision ultimately is the main one (80m 30s) but we're like we're like referencing (80m 32s) our understanding of human behavior and (80m 33s) some common sense (80m 37s) physics that could be inferred from (80m 38s) vision from from a perception (80m 41s) perspective but it feels like we're (80m 42s) using some kind of reasoning (80m 46s) to predict the world yeah not just the (80m 47s) pixels I mean you have a powerful prior (80m 50s) uh sorry right for how the world evolves (80m 53s) over time Etc so it's not just about the (80m 55s) likelihood term coming up from the data (80m 57s) itself telling you about what you are (80m 58s) observing but also the prior term of (81m 0s) like where where are the likely things (81m 2s) to see and how do they likely move and (81m 5s) so on and the question is how complex is (81m 6s) the uh (81m 9s) the the range of possibilities that (81m 12s) might happen in the driving task right (81m 14s) that's still is is that to you still an (81m 16s) open problem of how difficult is driving (81m 19s) like philosophically speaking (81m 23s) like do you all the time you've worked (81m 24s) on driving do you understand how hard (81m 27s) driving is yeah driving is really hard (81m 28s) because it has to do with the (81m 30s) predictions of all these other agents (81m 32s) and the theory of mind and you know what (81m 33s) they're gonna do and are they looking at (81m 35s) you are they where are they looking what (81m 37s) are they thinking yeah there's a lot (81m 38s) that goes there at the at the full tail (81m 41s) of you know the the expansion of the (81m 42s) nines that we have to be comfortable (81m 45s) with eventually the final problems are (81m 46s) of that form I don't think those are the (81m 48s) problems that are very common uh I think (81m 50s) eventually they're important but it's (81m 52s) like really in the tail end in the tail (81m 54s) and the rare edge cases (81m 57s) from the vision perspective what are the (81m 59s) toughest parts of the vision problem of (82m 2s) driving (82m 1s) um (82m 5s) well basically the sensor is extremely (82m 7s) powerful but you still need to process (82m 8s) that information (82m 11s) um and so going from brightnesses of (82m 13s) these pixel values to hey here the (82m 14s) three-dimensional world is extremely (82m 16s) hard and that's what the neural networks (82m 19s) are fundamentally doing and so (82m 20s) um the difficulty really is in just (82m 22s) doing an extremely good job of (82m 25s) engineering the entire pipeline uh the (82m 28s) entire data engine having the capacity (82m 29s) to train these neural nuts having the (82m 31s) ability to evaluate the system and (82m 34s) iterate on it uh so I would say just (82m 36s) doing this in production at scale is (82m 37s) like the hard part it's an execution (82m 41s) problem so the data engine but also the (82m 44s) um the sort of deployment of the system (82m 47s) such that has low latency performance so (82m 48s) it has to do all these steps yeah for (82m 50s) the neural net specifically just making (82m 52s) sure everything fits into the chip on (82m 54s) the car yeah and uh you have a finite (82m 56s) budget of flops that you can perform and (82m 58s) uh and memory bandwidth and other (83m 0s) constraints and you have to make sure it (83m 1s) flies and you can squeeze in as much (83m 3s) compute as you can into the tiny what (83m 5s) have you learned from that process (83m 6s) because it maybe that's one of the (83m 9s) bigger like new things coming from a (83m 11s) research background (83m 13s) where there's there's a system that has (83m 14s) to run under heavily constrained (83m 16s) resources right has to run really fast (83m 19s) what what kind of insights have you uh (83m 19s) learned from that (83m 22s) yeah I'm not sure if it's if there's too (83m 24s) many insights you're trying to create a (83m 27s) neural net that will fit in what you (83m 28s) have available and you're always trying (83m 30s) to optimize it and we talked a lot about (83m 33s) it on the AI day and uh basically the (83m 34s) the triple backflips that the team is (83m 36s) doing to make sure it all fits and (83m 39s) utilizes the engine uh so I think it's (83m 41s) extremely good engineering (83m 43s) um and then there's also all kinds of (83m 45s) little insights peppered in on how to do (83m 46s) it properly let's actually zoom out (83m 48s) because I don't think we talked about (83m 50s) the data engine the entirety of the (83m 53s) layout of this idea that I think is just (83m 57s) beautiful with humans in the loop can (83m 58s) you describe the data engine (84m 1s) yeah the data engine is what I call the (84m 4s) almost biological feeling like process (84m 7s) by which you uh perfect the training (84m 9s) sets for these neural networks (84m 10s) um so because most of the programming (84m 13s) now is in the level of these data sets (84m 14s) and make sure they're large diverse and (84m 17s) clean oh basically you have a data set (84m 18s) that you think is good you train your (84m 22s) neural net you deploy it and then you (84m 23s) observe how well it's performing and (84m 26s) you're trying to uh always increase the (84m 27s) quality of your data set so you're (84m 29s) trying to catch scenarios basically (84m 32s) there are basically rare and uh it is in (84m 33s) these scenarios that the neural Nets (84m 35s) will typically struggle in because they (84m 36s) weren't told what to do in those rare (84m 38s) cases in the data set but now you can (84m 40s) close the loop because if you can now (84m 42s) collect all those at scale you can then (84m 44s) feed them back into the Reconstruction (84m 47s) process I described and uh reconstruct (84m 48s) the truth in those cases and add it to (84m 50s) the data set and so the whole thing ends (84m 52s) up being like a staircase of improvement (84m 55s) of perfecting your training set and you (84m 56s) have to go through deployments so that (84m 59s) you can mine uh the parts that are not (85m 2s) yet represented well in the data set so (85m 3s) your data set is basically imperfect it (85m 5s) needs to be diverse it has pockets there (85m 7s) are missing and you need to pad out the (85m 9s) pockets you can sort of think of it that (85m 10s) way (85m 12s) in the data what role do humans play in (85m 14s) this so what's the uh this biological (85m 16s) system like a human body is made up of (85m 21s) cells what what role like how do you (85m 22s) optimize the human uh system the the (85m 25s) multiple Engineers collaborating (85m 28s) figuring out what to focus on what to (85m 31s) contribute which which task to optimize (85m 33s) in this neural network (85m 36s) uh who's in charge of figuring out which (85m 39s) task needs more data (85m 41s) can you speak to the hyper parameters (85m 44s) the human uh system right it really just (85m 46s) comes down to extremely good execution (85m 47s) from an engineering team and does what (85m 48s) they're doing they understand (85m 49s) intuitively the philosophical insights (85m 51s) underlying the data engine and the (85m 53s) process by which the system improves and (85m 56s) uh how to again like delegate the (85m 58s) strategy of the data collection and how (86m 0s) that works and then just making sure (86m 1s) it's all extremely well executed and (86m 3s) that's where most of the work is is not (86m 5s) even the philosophizing or the research (86m 7s) or the ideas of it it's just extremely (86m 8s) good execution it's so hard when you're (86m 10s) dealing with data at that scale so your (86m 13s) role in the data engine executing well (86m 15s) on it it is difficult and extremely (86m 18s) important is there a priority of like uh (86m 21s) like a vision board of saying like (86m 23s) we really need to get better at stop (86m 25s) lights (86m 27s) yeah like the the prioritization of (86m 29s) tasks is that essentially and that comes (86m 32s) from the data that comes to um a very (86m 33s) large extent to what we are trying to (86m 34s) achieve in the product for a map where (86m 35s) we're trying to the release we're trying (86m 37s) to get out (86m 39s) um in the feedback from the QA team (86m 40s) worth it where the system is struggling (86m 41s) or not the things we're trying to (86m 44s) improve and the QA team gives some (86m 46s) signal some information (86m 48s) in aggregate about the performance of (86m 50s) the system in various conditions and (86m 51s) then of course all of us drive it and we (86m 53s) can also see it it's really nice to work (86m 55s) with the system that you can also (86m 57s) experience yourself you know it drives (86m 59s) you home it's is there some insight you (87m 1s) can draw from your individual experience (87m 3s) that you just can't quite get from an (87m 6s) aggregate statistical analysis of data (87m 9s) yeah it's so weird right yes it's it's (87m 11s) not scientific in a sense because you're (87m 13s) just one anecdotal sample yeah I think (87m 16s) there's a ton of uh it's a source of (87m 18s) truth it's your interaction with the (87m 20s) system yeah and you can see it you can (87m 21s) play with it you can perturb it you can (87m 23s) get a sense of it you have an intuition (87m 25s) for it I think numbers just like have a (87m 27s) way of numbers and plots and graphs are (87m 30s) you know much harder yeah it hides a lot (87m 33s) of it's like if you train a language (87m 34s) model (87m 37s) it's a really powerful way is by you (87m 39s) interacting with it yeah 100 try to (87m 40s) build up an intuition yeah I think like (87m 43s) Elon also like he always wanted to drive (87m 45s) the system himself he drives a lot and (87m 49s) uh I'm gonna say almost daily so uh he (87m 51s) also sees this as a source of Truth you (87m 54s) driving the system uh and it performing (87m 58s) and yeah so what do you think tough (88m 0s) questions here uh so Tesla last year (88m 4s) removed radar from um from the sensor (88m 6s) suite and now just announced that it's (88m 8s) going to remove all ultrasonic sensors (88m 12s) relying solely on Vision so camera only (88m 13s) does that make the perception problem (88m 17s) harder or easier (88m 18s) I would almost reframe the question in (88m 21s) some way so the thing is basically you (88m 23s) would think that additional sensors by (88m 25s) the way can I just interrupt good I (88m 26s) wonder if a language model will ever do (88m 29s) that if you prompt it let me reframe (88m 32s) your question that would be epic this is (88m 35s) the wrong problem sorry it's like a (88m 35s) little bit of a wrong question because (88m 37s) basically you would think that these (88m 40s) sensors are an asset to you yeah but if (88m 43s) you fully consider the entire product in (88m 44s) its entirety (88m 45s) these sensors are actually potentially (88m 47s) reliability (88m 49s) because these sensors aren't free they (88m 51s) don't just appear on your car you need (88m 53s) something you need to have an entire (88m 54s) supply chain you have people procuring (88m 56s) it there can be problems with them they (88m 57s) may need replacement they are part of (88m 58s) the manufacturing process they can hold (89m 1s) back the line in production you need to (89m 2s) Source them you need to maintain them (89m 4s) you have to have teams that write the (89m 7s) firmware all of it and then you also (89m 8s) have to incorporate and fuse them into (89m 9s) the system in some way and so it (89m 13s) actually like bloats the organ the a lot (89m 15s) of it and I think Elon is really good at (89m 17s) simplify simplified best part is no part (89m 19s) and he always tries to throw away things (89m 21s) that are not essential because he (89m 21s) understands the entropy in organizations (89m 25s) and approach and I think uh in this case (89m 26s) the cost is high and you're not (89m 27s) potentially seeing it if you're just a (89m 29s) computer vision engineer and I'm just (89m 31s) trying to improve my network and you (89m 33s) know is it more useful or less useful (89m 36s) how useful is it and the thing is if (89m 36s) once you consider the full cost of a (89m 39s) sensor it actually is potentially a (89m 40s) liability and you need to be really sure (89m 42s) that it's giving you extremely useful (89m 44s) information in this case we looked at (89m 46s) using it or not using it and the Delta (89m 49s) was not massive and so it's not useful (89m 52s) is it also blow in the data engine like (89m 54s) having more sensors (89m 56s) is a distraction and these sensors you (89m 57s) know they can change over time for (89m 59s) example you can have one type of say (90m 0s) radar you can have other type of radar (90m 2s) they change over time I suddenly need to (90m 2s) worry about it now suddenly you have a (90m 5s) column in your sqlite telling you oh (90m 6s) which sensor type was it and they all (90m 9s) have different distributions and then uh (90m 11s) they can they just they contribute noise (90m 13s) and entropy into everything and they (90m 15s) bloat stuff and also organizationally (90m 17s) has been really fascinating to me that (90m 19s) it can be very distracting (90m 22s) um if you if all if you only want to get (90m 24s) to work is Vision all the resources are (90m 25s) on it and you're building out a data (90m 27s) engine and you're actually making (90m 29s) forward progress because that is the the (90m 32s) sensor with the most bandwidth the most (90m 33s) constraints on the world and you're (90m 34s) investing fully into that and you can (90m 37s) make that extremely good if you're uh (90m 38s) you're only a finite amount of sort of (90m 41s) spend of focus across different facets (90m 44s) of the system and uh this kind of (90m 46s) reminds me of Rich Sutton's a bitter (90m 49s) lesson it just seems like simplifying (90m 50s) the system yeah (90m 52s) in the long run now of course you don't (90m 55s) know what the long run it seems to be (90m 56s) always the right solution yeah yes in (90m 58s) that case it was 4rl but it seems to (91m 0s) apply generally across all systems that (91m 3s) do computation yeah so where uh what do (91m 5s) you think about the lidar as a crutch (91m 6s) debate (91m 9s) uh the battle between point clouds and (91m 10s) pixels (91m 12s) yeah I think this debate is always like (91m 14s) slightly confusing to me because it (91m 15s) seems like the actual debate should be (91m 17s) about like do you have the fleet or not (91m 19s) that's like the really important thing (91m 20s) about whether you can achieve a really (91m 23s) good functioning of an AI system at this (91m 25s) scale so data collection systems yeah do (91m 26s) you have a fleet or not it's (91m 28s) significantly more important whether you (91m 30s) have lidar or not it's just another (91m 30s) sensor (91m 33s) um and uh (91m 35s) yeah I think similar to the radar (91m 38s) discussion basically I um (91m 39s) but yeah I don't think it it um (91m 42s) basically doesn't offer extra extra (91m 44s) information is extremely costly it has (91m 45s) all kinds of problems you have to worry (91m 47s) about it you have to calibrate it Etc it (91m 49s) creates bloat and entropy you have to be (91m 51s) really sure that you need this uh this (91m 53s) um sensor in this case I basically don't (91m 56s) think you need it and I think honestly I (91m 57s) will make a stronger statement I think (91m 59s) the others some of the other uh (92m 0s) companies are using it are probably (92m 3s) going to drop it yeah so you have to (92m 6s) consider the sensor in the full (92m 9s) in considering can you build a big Fleet (92m 12s) that collects a lot of data and can you (92m 14s) integrate that sensor with that that (92m 16s) data and that sensor into a data engine (92m 18s) that's able to quickly find different (92m 21s) parts of the data that then continuously (92m 22s) improves whatever the model that you're (92m 24s) using yeah another way to look at it is (92m 27s) like vision is necessary in a sense that (92m 30s) uh the drive the world is designed for (92m 31s) human visual consumption so you need (92m 34s)\",\n",
       " \"vision is necessary and then also it is (92m 36s) sufficient because it has all the (92m 37s) information that you that you need for (92m 40s) driving and humans obviously is a vision (92m 41s) to drive so it's both necessary and (92m 42s) sufficient so you want to focus (92m 43s) resources and you have to be really sure (92m 45s) if you're going to bring in other (92m 47s) sensors you could you could you could (92m 49s) add sensors to Infinity at some point (92m 51s) you need to draw the line and I think in (92m 52s) this case you have to really consider (92m 55s) the full cost of any One sensor that (92m 57s) you're adopting and do you really need (92m 59s) it and I think the answer in this case (93m 1s) is no so what do you think about the (93m 4s) idea of the that the other companies (93m 6s) are forming high resolution maps and (93m 9s) constraining heavily the geographic (93m 11s) regions in which they operate is that (93m 15s) approach not in your in your view (93m 18s) um not going to scale over time to the (93m 20s) entirety of the United States I think (93m 22s) I'll take two as you mentioned like they (93m 24s) pre-map all the environments and they (93m 25s) need to refresh the map and they have a (93m 27s) perfect centimeter level accuracy map of (93m 29s) everywhere they're going to drive it's (93m 31s) crazy how are you going to (93m 33s) when we're talking about autonomy (93m 33s) actually changing the world we're (93m 36s) talking about the deployment (93m 38s) on a on a global scale of autonomous (93m 40s) systems for transportation and if you (93m 41s) need to maintain a centimeter accurate (93m 44s) map for Earth or like for many cities (93m 46s) and keep them updated it's a huge (93m 48s) dependency that you're taking on huge (93m 48s) dependency (93m 50s) it's a massive massive dependency and (93m 52s) now you need to ask yourself do you (93m 53s) really need it (93m 55s) and humans don't need it (93m 58s) um right so it's it's very useful to (94m 0s) have a low-level map of like okay the (94m 1s) connectivity of your road you know that (94m 3s) there's a fork coming up when you drive (94m 4s) an environment you sort of have that (94m 5s) high level understanding it's like a (94m 7s) small Google Map and Tesla uses Google (94m 10s) Map like similar kind of resolution (94m 12s) information in the system but it will (94m 15s) not pre-map environments to send me a (94m 16s) level accuracy it's a crutch it's a (94m 19s) distraction it costs entropy and it (94m 21s) diffuses the team it dilutes the team (94m 22s) and you're not focusing on what's (94m 24s) actually necessary which is the computer (94m 25s) vision problem (94m 27s) what did you learn about machine (94m 30s) learning about engineering about life (94m 34s) about yourself as one human being from (94m 36s) working with Elon Musk (94m 37s) I think the most I've learned is about (94m 39s) how to sort of run organizations (94m 41s) efficiently and how to (94m 43s) create efficient organizations and how (94m 46s) to fight entropy in an organization so (94m 47s) human Engineering in the fight against (94m 50s) entropy yeah there's a there's a I think (94m 53s) Elon is a very efficient warrior in the (94m 55s) fight against entropy in organizations (94m 56s) what is the entropy in an organization (95m 0s) look like exactly it's process it's (95m 4s) it's process and inefficiencies and that (95m 7s) kind of stuff yeah meetings he hates (95m 8s) meetings he keeps telling people to skip (95m 10s) meetings if they're not useful (95m 11s) um he basically runs the world's biggest (95m 15s) uh startups I would say uh Tesla SpaceX (95m 17s) are the world's biggest startups Tesla (95m 19s) actually has multiple startups I think (95m 20s) it's better to look at it that way and (95m 23s) so I think he's he's extremely good at (95m 26s) uh at that and uh yeah he's a very good (95m 27s) intuition for streamline processes (95m 30s) making everything efficient uh best part (95m 32s) is no part uh simplifying focusing (95m 35s) um and just kind of removing barriers uh (95m 37s) moving very quickly making big moves all (95m 40s) this is a very startupy sort of seeming (95m 42s) things but at scale so strong drive to (95m 45s) simplify for me from your perspective I (95m 45s) mean that (95m 48s) um that also probably applies to just (95m 49s) designing systems and machine learning (95m 51s) and otherwise yeah like simplify (95m 53s) simplify yes (95m 54s) what do you think is the secret to (95m 57s) maintaining the startup culture in a (96m 0s) company that grows is there (96m 2s) can you introspect that (96m 5s) I do think you need someone in a (96m 6s) powerful position with a big hammer like (96m 9s) Elon who's like the cheerleader for that (96m 11s) idea and ruthless ruthlessly pursues it (96m 13s) if no one has a big enough Hammer (96m 16s) everything turns into committees (96m 19s) democracy within the company uh process (96m 21s) talking to stakeholders decision making (96m 23s) just everything just crumbles yeah if (96m 26s) you have a big person who's also really (96m 27s) smart and has a big hammer things move (96m 30s) quickly so you said your favorite scene (96m 33s) in interstellar is the intense docking (96m 35s) scene with the AI and Cooper talking (96m 36s) saying uh Cooper what are you doing (96m 40s) docking it's not possible no it's (96m 41s) necessary (96m 44s) such a good line by the way just so many (96m 47s) questions there why in AI (96m 50s) in that scene presumably is supposed to (96m 51s) be (96m 53s) able to compute a lot more than the (96m 56s) human is saying it's not optimal why the (96m 58s) human I mean that's a movie but (97m 0s) shouldn't they AI know much better than (97m 1s) the human (97m 4s) anyway uh what do you think is the value (97m 7s) of setting seemingly impossible goals (97m 9s) so like uh (97m 11s) our initial intuition which seems like (97m 13s) something that (97m 17s) you have taken on that Elon espouses (97m 19s) that where the initial intuition of the (97m 20s) community might say this is very (97m 22s) difficult and then you take it on anyway (97m 24s) with a crazy deadline you're just from a (97m 26s) human engineering perspective (97m 27s) um (97m 31s) uh have you seen the value of that (97m 33s) I wouldn't say that setting impossible (97m 35s) goals exactly is is a good idea but I (97m 36s) think setting very ambitious goals is a (97m 40s) good idea I think there's a what I call (97m 41s) sublinear scaling of difficulty uh which (97m 44s) means that 10x problems are not 10x hard (97m 48s) usually 10x 10x harder problem is like 2 (97m 51s) or 3x harder to execute on because if (97m 52s) you want to actually like if you want to (97m 54s) improve the system by 10 it costs some (97m 55s) amount of work and if you want to 10x (97m 58s) improve the system it doesn't cost you (98m 0s) know 100x amount of the work and it's (98m 1s) because you fundamentally change the (98m 2s) approach and it if you start with that (98m 4s) constraint then some approaches are (98m 6s) obviously dumb and not going to work and (98m 9s) it forces you to reevaluate (98m 11s) um and I think it's a very interesting (98m 13s) way of approaching problem solving but (98m 15s) it requires a weird kind of thinking (98m 17s) it's just going back to your like PhD (98m 22s) days it's like how do you think which (98m 24s) ideas in in the machine Learning (98m 28s) Community are solvable yes it's uh it (98m 30s) requires what is that I mean there's the (98m 33s) cliche of first prince people's thinking (98m 35s) but like it requires to basically ignore (98m 36s) what the community is saying because (98m 38s) doesn't the community doesn't a (98m 41s) community in science usually draw lines (98m 44s) of what isn't isn't possible right and (98m 47s) like it's very hard to break out of that (98m 49s) without going crazy yep I mean I think a (98m 51s) good example here is you know the Deep (98m 51s) learning revolution in some sense (98m 55s) because you could be in computer vision (98m 56s) at that time when during the Deep (98m 59s) learning sort of revolution of 2012 and (99m 1s) so on uh you could be improving your (99m 3s) computer vision stack by 10 or we can (99m 5s) just be saying actually all this is (99m 6s) useless and how do I do 10x better (99m 8s) computer vision well it's not probably (99m 11s) by tuning a hog feature detector I need (99m 12s) a different approach (99m 13s) um I need something that is scalable (99m 16s) going back to uh Richard Sutton's um and (99m 17s) understanding sort of like the (99m 20s) philosophy of the uh bitter lesson and (99m 22s) then being like actually I need a much (99m 23s) more scalable system like a neural (99m 25s) network that in principle works and then (99m 26s) having some deep Believers that can (99m 28s) actually execute on that mission and (99m 33s) make it work so that's the 10x solution (99m 32s) what do you think is the timeline to (99m 38s) solve the problem of autonomous driving (99m 42s) this still in part an open question (99m 43s) yeah I think the tough thing with (99m 45s) timelines of self-driving obviously is (99m 47s) that no one has created self-driving (99m 50s) yeah so it's not like what do you think (99m 51s) is a timeline to build this bridge well (99m 52s) we've built million Bridges before (99m 55s) here's how long that takes it's it you (99m 57s) know it's uh no one has built autonomy (100m 1s) it's not obvious uh some parts turn out (100m 2s) to be much easier than others so it's (100m 4s) really hard to forecast you do your best (100m 7s) based on trend lines and so on and based (100m 7s) on intuition but that's why (100m 9s) fundamentally it's just really hard to (100m 11s) forecast this no one has even still like (100m 14s) being inside of it is hard to uh to do (100m 16s) yes some things turn out to be much (100m 17s) harder and some things turn out to be (100m 18s) much easier (100m 21s) do you try to avoid making forecasts (100m 22s) because like Elon doesn't avoid them (100m 25s) right and heads of car companies in the (100m 28s) past have not avoided it either uh Ford (100m 31s) and other places have made predictions (100m 33s) that we're going to solve at level four (100m 36s) driving by 2020 2021 whatever and now (100m 37s) they're all kind of Backtrack on that (100m 39s) prediction (100m 41s) IU as a (100m 44s) as an AI person (100m 47s) do you free yourself privately make (100m 49s) predictions or do they get in the way of (100m 52s) like your actual ability to think about (100m 52s) a thing (100m 55s) yeah I would say like what's easy to say (100m 57s) is that this problem is tractable and (100m 58s) that's an easy prediction to make (101m 1s) extractable it's going to work yes it's (101m 2s) just really hard some things turn out to (101m 3s) be harder than some things turn out to (101m 6s) be easier uh so uh but it definitely (101m 9s) feels tractable and it feels like at (101m 10s) least the team at Tesla which is what I (101m 12s) saw internally is definitely on track to (101m 15s) that how do you form (101m 17s) a uh strong representation that allows (101m 19s) you to make a prediction about (101m 21s) tractability so like you're the leader (101m 24s) of a lot a lot of humans (101m 26s) you have to kind of say this is actually (101m 27s) possible (101m 30s) like how do you build up that intuition (101m 32s) it doesn't have to be even driving it (101m 34s) could be other tasks it could be um and (101m 36s) I wonder what difficult tasks did you (101m 37s) work on in your life I mean (101m 39s) classification (101m 41s) achieving certain just an image that (101m 43s) certain level of superhuman level (101m 47s) performance yeah expert intuition (101m 50s) it's just intuition it's belief (101m 51s) so just like thinking about it long (101m 53s) enough like studying looking at sample (101m 55s) data like you said driving (101m 58s) uh my intuition has really flawed on (102m 0s) this like I don't have a good intuition (102m 2s) about tractability it could be either it (102m 5s) could be anything it could be solvable (102m 8s) like uh you know the driving task could (102m 11s) could be simplified into something quite (102m 14s) trivial like uh the solution to the (102m 16s) problem would be quite trivial and at (102m 17s) scale more and more cars driving (102m 20s) perfectly (102m 21s) might make the problem much easier Yeah (102m 24s) the more cars you have driving like (102m 26s) people learn how to drive correctly not (102m 28s) correctly but in a way that's more (102m 32s) optimal for a heterogeneous system of (102m 34s) autonomous and semi-autonomous and (102m 36s) manually driven cars that could change (102m 39s) stuff then again also I've spent a (102m 40s) ridiculous number of hours just staring (102m 43s) at pedestrians crossing streets thinking (102m 47s) about humans and it feels like the way (102m 50s) we use our eye contact (102m 52s) it sends really strong signals and (102m 54s) there's certain quirks and edge cases of (102m 56s) behavior and of course a lot of the (102m 58s) fatalities that happen have to do with (103m 0s) drunk driving and (103m 2s) um both on The Pedestrian side and the (103m 5s) driver's side so there's that problem of (103m 5s) driving at night and all that kind of (103m 8s) yeah so I wonder you know it's like the (103m 9s) space (103m 11s) of possible solution to autonomous (103m 14s) driving includes so many human factor (103m 15s) issues (103m 17s) that it's almost impossible to predict (103m 19s) there could be super clean nice (103m 21s) Solutions yeah I would say definitely (103m 23s) like to use a game analogy there's some (103m 26s) fog of War but you definitely also see (103m 28s) the frontier of improvement and you can (103m 29s) measure historically how much you've (103m 32s) made progress and I think for example at (103m 34s) least what I've seen in uh roughly five (103m 36s) years at Tesla when I joined it barely (103m 38s) kept laying on the highway I think going (103m 40s) up from Palo Alto to SF was like three (103m 42s) or four interventions anytime the road (103m 44s) would do anything geometrically or turn (103m 47s) too much it would just like not work and (103m 48s) so going from that to like a pretty (103m 50s) competent system in five years and (103m 51s) seeing what happens also under the hood (103m 53s) and what the scale which the team is (103m 54s) operating now with respect to data and (103m 57s) compute and everything else uh is just a (103m 59s) massive progress (104m 2s) so there's a you're climbing a mountain (104m 4s) and it's fog but you're making a lot of (104m 6s) progress fog you're making progress and (104m 7s) you see what the next directions are and (104m 8s) you're looking at some of the remaining (104m 11s) challenges and they're not like uh (104m 12s) they're not perturbing you and they're (104m 13s) not changing your philosophy and you're (104m 15s) not contorting yourself you're like (104m 16s) actually these are the things that we (104m 18s) still need to do yeah the fundamental (104m 19s) components of solving the problems seem (104m 22s) to be there for the data engine to the (104m 23s) compute to the the computer on the car (104m 25s) to the compute for the training all that (104m 26s) kind of stuff (104m 27s) so you've done (104m 30s) uh over the years you've been a test (104m 32s) you've done a lot of amazing uh (104m 34s) breakthrough ideas and Engineering all (104m 35s) of it (104m 38s) um from the data engine to The Human (104m 40s) Side all of it can you speak to why you (104m 44s) chose to leave Tesla basically as I (104m 46s) described that ran I think over time (104m 48s) during those five years I've kind of uh (104m 50s) gotten myself into a little bit of a (104m 52s) managerial position most of my days were (104m 54s) you know meetings and growing the (104m 56s) organization and making decisions about (104m 58s) sort of high level strategic decisions (105m 0s) about the team and what it should be (105m 3s) working on and so on and uh (105m 5s) it's kind of like a corporate executive (105m 7s) role and I can do it I think I'm okay at (105m 9s) it but it's not like fundamentally what (105m 12s) I what I enjoy and so I think uh when I (105m 13s) joined uh there was no computer vision (105m 16s) team because Tesla was just going from (105m 17s) the transition of using mobileye a (105m 18s) third-party vendor for all of its (105m 20s) computer vision to having to build its (105m 22s) computer vision system so when I showed (105m 22s) up there were two people training deep (105m 25s) neural networks and they were training (105m 27s) them at a computer at their at their (105m 29s) legs like uh (105m 31s) kind of basic classification task yeah (105m 34s) and so (105m 35s) I kind of like grew that into what I (105m 37s) think is a fairly respectable deep (105m 39s) learning team a massive compute cluster (105m 41s) a very good um data annotation (105m 43s) organization and uh I was very happy (105m 45s) with where that was it became quite (105m 47s) autonomous and so I kind of stepped away (105m 49s) and I uh you know I'm very excited to do (105m 52s) much more technical things again (105m 54s) yeah and kind of like we focus on AGI (105m 56s) what was this soul searching like (105m 57s) because you took a little time off and (105m 59s) think like what um how many mushrooms (106m 2s) did you take no I'm just uh I mean what (106m 3s) what was going through your mind the (106m 6s) human lifetime is finite yeah he did a (106m 9s) few incredible things you're you're one (106m 10s) of the best teachers of AI in the world (106m 13s) you're one of the best and I don't mean (106m 15s) that I mean that in the best possible (106m 18s) way you're one of the best tinkerers in (106m 20s) the AI world meaning like understanding (106m 22s) the fundamental fundamentals of how (106m 25s) something works by building it from (106m 27s) scratch and playing with it with the (106m 29s) basic intuitions it's like Einstein (106m 30s) feinmen were all really good at this (106m 33s) kind of stuff like a small example of a (106m 35s) thing to to play with it to try to (106m 37s) understand it uh so that and obviously (106m 40s) now with us that you help build a team (106m 43s) of machine learning (106m 45s) um uh like engineers and a system that (106m 46s) actually accomplishes something in the (106m 49s) real world so given all that like what (106m 51s) was the soul searching like (106m 53s) well it was hard because obviously I (106m 55s) love the company a lot and I love I love (106m 58s) Elon I love Tesla I want um (107m 0s) it was hard to leave I love the team (107m 1s) basically (107m 3s) um but (107m 5s) yeah I think actually I would (107m 6s) potentially like interested in (107m 8s) revisiting it maybe coming back at some (107m 11s) point uh working in Optimus working in (107m 13s) AGI at Tesla uh I think Tesla is going (107m 15s) to do incredible things it's basically (107m 17s) like (107m 20s) uh it's a massive large-scale robotics (107m 22s) kind of company with a ton of In-House (107m 24s) talent for doing really incredible (107m 26s) things and I think uh (107m 29s) human robots are going to be amazing I (107m 31s) think autonomous transportation is going (107m 32s) to be amazing all this is happening at (107m 34s) Tesla so I think it's just a really (107m 35s) amazing organization so being part of it (107m 37s) and helping it along I think was very (107m 39s) basically I enjoyed that a lot yeah it (107m 40s) was basically difficult for those (107m 43s) reasons because I love the company uh (107m 44s) but you know I'm happy to potentially at (107m 46s) some point come back for act two but I (107m 48s) felt like at this stage (107m 51s) I built the team it felt autonomous and (107m 53s) uh I became a manager and I wanted to do (107m 54s) a lot more technical stuff I wanted to (107m 56s) learn stuff I wanted to teach stuff and (107m 59s) uh I just kind of felt like it was a (108m 0s) good time for for a change of pace a (108m 3s) little bit what do you think is uh the (108m 5s) best movie sequel of all time speaking (108m 8s) of part two because like because most of (108m 11s) them suck in movie sequels yeah and you (108m 13s) tweet about movies so just in a tiny (108m 15s) tangent is there what's your what was (108m 17s) like a favorite movie sequel (108m 20s) Godfather Part Two (108m 21s) um are you a fan of Godfather because (108m 22s)\",\n",
       " \"you didn't even tweet or mention the (108m 23s) Godfather yeah I don't love that movie I (108m 26s) know it hasn't edit that out we're gonna (108m 27s) edit out the hate towards the Godfather (108m 30s) how dare you just I think I will make a (108m 31s) strong statement I don't know why I (108m 33s) don't know why but I basically don't (108m 37s) like any movie before 1995 (108m 38s) something like that didn't you mention (108m 41s) Terminator two okay okay that's like uh (108m 44s) Terminator 2 was a little bit later 1990 (108m 47s) no I think Terminator 2 was a name I (108m 49s) like Terminator one as well so okay so (108m 50s) like a few exceptions but by and large (108m 52s) for some reason I don't like movies (108m 55s) before 1995 or something they feel very (108m 57s) slow the camera is like zoomed out it's (109m 0s) boring it's kind of naive it's kind of (109m 2s) weird and also Terminator was very much (109m 4s) ahead of its time yes and The Godfather (109m 5s) there's like no AGI (109m 9s) [Laughter] (109m 11s) I mean but you have Good Will Hunting (109m 13s) was one of the movies you mentioned and (109m 15s) that doesn't have any AGI either I guess (109m 17s) that's mathematics yeah I guess (109m 19s) occasionally I do enjoy movies that (109m 21s) don't feature or like Anchorman that has (109m 24s) no that's the increment it's so good I (109m 27s) don't understand (109m 28s) um speaking of AGI because I don't (109m 31s) understand why Will Ferrell is so funny (109m 33s) it doesn't make sense it doesn't compute (109m 35s) there's just something about him and (109m 36s) he's a singular human because you don't (109m 38s) get that many comedies (109m 40s) these days and I wonder if it has to do (109m 43s) about the culture uh or the like the (109m 45s) machine of Hollywood or does it have to (109m 46s) do with just we got lucky with certain (109m 48s) people and comedy it came together (109m 51s) because he is a singular human (109m 54s) that was a ridiculous tangent I (109m 56s) apologize but you mentioned humanoid (109m 58s) robot so what do you think about Optimus (110m 0s) about Tesla bot do you think we'll have (110m 3s) robots in the factory in in the home in (110m 6s) 10 20 30 40 50 years yeah I think it's a (110m 7s) very hard project I think it's going to (110m 9s) take a while but who else is going to (110m 12s) build humano robots at scale yeah and I (110m 13s) think it is a very good form factor to (110m 14s) go after because like I mentioned the (110m 16s) the world is designed for humanoid form (110m 18s) factor these things would be able to (110m 20s) operate our machines they would be able (110m 21s) to sit down in chairs uh potentially (110m 24s) even drive cars uh basically the world (110m 25s) is designed for humans that's the form (110m 28s) factor you want to invest into and make (110m 30s) work over time uh I think you know (110m 31s) there's another school of thought which (110m 33s) is okay pick a problem and design a (110m 34s) robot to it but actually designing a (110m 35s) robot and getting a whole data engine (110m 37s) and everything behind it to work is (110m 39s) actually an incredibly hard problem so (110m 40s) it makes sense to go after General (110m 43s) interfaces that uh okay they are not (110m 44s) perfect for any one given task but they (110m 46s) actually have the generality of just (110m 49s) with a prompt with English able to do (110m 51s) something across and so I think it makes (110m 53s) a lot of sense to go after a general uh (110m 55s) interface (110m 58s) um in the physical world and I think (111m 0s) it's a very difficult project I think (111m 2s) it's going to take time but I see no (111m 4s) other no other company that can execute (111m 4s) on that Vision I think it's going to be (111m 7s) amazing like uh basically physical labor (111m 9s) like if you think transportation is a (111m 13s) large Market try physical labor insane (111m 15s) well but it's not just physical labor to (111m 17s) me the thing that's also exciting is the (111m 19s) social robotics so the the relationship (111m 21s) we'll have on different levels with (111m 24s) those robots that's why I was really (111m 27s) excited to see Optimus like um people (111m 29s) have criticized me for the excitement (111m 34s) but I've I've worked with uh uh a lot of (111m 36s) research Labs that do humanoid legged (111m 39s) robots Boston Dynamics unitary a lot (111m 40s) there's a lot of companies that do (111m 45s) legged robots but that's the the (111m 49s) Elegance of the movement is a tiny tiny (111m 52s) part of the big picture so integrating (111m 54s) the two big exciting things to me about (111m 57s) Tesla doing humanoid or any Lego robots (111m 58s) is (112m 1s) clearly integrating it into the data (112m 5s) engine so the the data engine aspect so (112m 7s) the actual intelligence for the (112m 8s) perception and the and the control and (112m 10s) the planning and all that kind of stuff (112m 12s) integrating into this huge the fleet (112m 13s) that you mentioned right (112m 17s) um and then speaking of Fleet the second (112m 19s) thing is the mass manufacturers Just (112m 19s) knowing (112m 22s) uh culturally (112m 26s) uh driving towards a simple robot that's (112m 29s) cheap to produce at scale yeah and doing (112m 31s) that well having experience to do that (112m 32s) well that changes everything that's why (112m 35s) that's a very different culture and (112m 37s) style than Boston Dynamics who by the (112m 39s) way those those robots are just the the (112m 43s) way they move it's uh like it'll be a (112m 44s) very long time before Tesla could (112m 46s) achieve the smoothness of movement but (112m 49s) that's not what it's about it's it's (112m 51s) about uh it's about the entirety of the (112m 52s) system like we talked about the data (112m 55s) engine and the fleet that's super (112m 56s) exciting even the initial sort of models (112m 59s) uh but that too was really surprising (113m 2s) that in a few months you can get a (113m 4s) prototype yep and the reason that (113m 6s) happened very quickly is as you alluded (113m 7s) to there's a ton of copy based from (113m 9s) what's happening in the autopilot yes a (113m 11s) lot the amount of expertise that like (113m 13s) came out of the Woodworks at Tesla for (113m 15s) building the human robot was incredible (113m 17s) to see like basically Elon said at one (113m 20s) point we're doing this and then (113m 22s) next day basically like all these CAD (113m 23s) models started to appear and people talk (113m 24s) about like the supply chain and (113m 27s) Manufacturing and uh people showed up (113m 28s) with like screwdrivers and everything (113m 31s) like the other day and started to like (113m 32s) put together the body and I was like (113m 33s) whoa like all these people exist at (113m 35s) Tesla and fundamentally building a car (113m 36s) is actually not that different from (113m 37s) building a robot the same and that is (113m 40s) true uh not just for uh the hardware (113m 42s) pieces and also let's not forget (113m 45s) Hardware not just for a demo but (113m 48s) manufacturing of that Hardware at scale (113m 49s) is like a whole different thing but for (113m 52s) software as well basically this robot (113m 54s) currently thinks it's a car (113m 58s) uh it's gonna have a midlife crisis at (114m 0s) some point it thinks it's a car (114m 2s) um some of the earlier demos actually we (114m 2s) were talking about potentially doing (114m 4s) them outside in the parking lot because (114m 5s) that's where all of the computer vision (114m 8s) that was like working out of the box (114m 11s) instead of like in inside (114m 12s) um but all the operating system (114m 14s) everything just copy pastes uh computer (114m 16s) vision mostly copy paste I mean you have (114m 17s) to retrain the neural Nets but the (114m 18s) approach and everything in data engine (114m 20s) and offline trackers and the way we go (114m 21s) about the occupancy tracker and so on (114m 23s) everything copy paste you just need to (114m 26s) retrain the neural Lots uh and then the (114m 27s) planning control of course has to change (114m 29s) quite a bit but there's a ton of copy (114m 30s) paste from what's happening at Tesla and (114m 33s) so if you were to if you were to go with (114m 34s) goal of like okay let's build a million (114m 36s) human robots and you're not Tesla that's (114m 39s) that's a lot to ask if you're a Tesla (114m 40s) it's actually like (114m 42s) it's not it's not that crazy and then (114m 45s) the the follow-up question is and how (114m 46s) difficult just like we're driving how (114m 48s) difficult is the manipulation task uh (114m 50s) such that it can have an impact at scale (114m 52s) I think (114m 53s) depending on the context the really nice (114m 57s) thing about robotics is the um unless (114m 59s) you do a manufacturing that kind of (115m 1s) stuff is there's more room for error (115m 3s) driving is so safety critical and so (115m 6s) that and also time critical robot is (115m 9s) allowed to move slower which is nice yes (115m 12s) I think it's going to take a long time (115m 13s) but the way you want to structure the (115m 15s) development is you need to say okay it's (115m 17s) going to take a long time how can I set (115m 20s) up the uh product development roadmap so (115m 21s) that I'm making Revenue along the way (115m 23s) I'm not setting myself up for a zero one (115m 25s) loss function where it doesn't work (115m 26s) until it works you don't want to be in (115m 28s) that position you want to make it useful (115m 29s) almost immediately and then you want to (115m 34s) slowly deploy it uh and uh at scale and (115m 35s) you want to set up your data engine your (115m 37s) improvement Loops the Telemetry the (115m 39s) evaluation the harness and everything (115m 42s) and you want to improve the product over (115m 43s) time incorrectly and you're making (115m 44s) Revenue along the way that's extremely (115m 46s) important because otherwise you cannot (115m 49s) build these these uh large undertakings (115m 50s) just like don't make sense economically (115m 52s) and also from the point of view of the (115m 53s) team working on it they need the (115m 55s) dopamine along the way they're not just (115m 57s) going to make a promise about this being (115m 58s) useful this is going to change the world (116m 0s) in 10 years when it works this is not (116m 2s) where you want to be you want to be in a (116m 4s) place like I think autopilot is today (116m 7s) where it's offering increased safety and (116m 8s) um and uh convenience of driving today (116m 11s) people pay for it people like it people (116m 13s) purchase it and then you also have the (116m 14s) greater mission that you're working (116m 15s) towards (116m 17s) and you see that so the dopamine for the (116m 20s) team that that was a source of Happiness (116m 22s) yes you're deploying this people like it (116m 24s) people drive it people pay for it they (116m 26s) care about it there's all these YouTube (116m 28s) videos your grandma drives it she gives (116m 29s) you feedback people like it people (116m 31s) engage with it you engage with it huge (116m 34s) do uh people that drive Teslas like (116m 36s) recognize you and give you love like uh (116m 40s) like hey thanks for the for the this (116m 42s) nice feature that it's doing yeah I (116m 43s) think the tricky thing is like some (116m 44s) people really love you some people (116m 46s) unfortunately like you're working on (116m 47s) something that you think is extremely (116m 49s) valuable useful Etc some people do hate (116m 51s) you there's a lot of people who like (116m 53s) hate me and the team and whatever the (116m 55s) whole project and I think they have (116m 58s) Tesla drivers uh many cases they're not (117m 0s) actually yeah that's that's actually (117m 4s) makes me sad about humans or the current (117m 6s) the ways that humans interact I think (117m 7s) that's actually fixable I think humans (117m 9s) want to be good to each other I think (117m 11s) Twitter and social media is part of the (117m 13s) mechanism that actually somehow makes (117m 16s) the negativity more viral but it doesn't (117m 19s) deserve like disproportionately uh add (117m 22s) of like a viral viral boost yeah (117m 24s) negativity but like I wish people would (117m 27s) just get excited about uh so suppress (117m 30s) some of the jealousy some of the ego and (117m 31s) just get excited for others and then (117m 34s) there's a Karma aspect to that you get (117m 35s) excited for others they'll get excited (117m 37s) for you same thing in Academia if you're (117m 40s) not careful there's a like a dynamical (117m 42s) system there if you if you think of in (117m 44s) silos and get jealous of somebody else (117m 47s) being successful that actually perhaps (117m 50s) counterintuitively uh leads the less (117m 51s) productivity of you as a community and (117m 54s) you individually I feel like if you keep (117m 57s) celebrating others that actually makes (118m 0s) you more successful yeah I think people (118m 2s) haven't in depending on the industry (118m 3s) haven't quite learned that yet yeah some (118m 5s) people are also very negative and very (118m 6s) vocal so they're very prominently (118m 8s) featured but actually there's a ton of (118m 10s) people who are cheerleaders but they're (118m 12s) silent cheerlead cheerleaders and uh (118m 15s) when you talk to people just in the (118m 16s) world they will all tell you it's (118m 17s) amazing it's great especially like (118m 18s) people who understand how difficult it (118m 20s) is to get this stuff working like people (118m 21s) who have built products and makers (118m 23s) entrepreneur entrepreneurs like make (118m 26s) making this work and changing something (118m 28s) is is incredibly hard those people are (118m 31s) more likely to cheerlead you well one of (118m 33s) the things that makes me sad is some (118m 34s) folks in the robotics Community uh don't (118m 36s) do the cheerleading and they should (118m 38s) there's uh because they know how (118m 39s) difficult it is well they actually (118m 40s) sometimes don't know how difficult it is (118m 42s) to create a product at scale right they (118m 45s) actually deploy in the real world a lot (118m 46s) of the (118m 49s) development of robots and AI systems is (118m 53s) done on very specific small benchmarks (118m 54s) um and as opposed to real world (118m 55s) conditions yes (118m 58s) yeah I think it's really hard to work on (119m 0s) robotics in academic setting or AI (119m 1s) systems that apply in the real world you (119m 6s) you've criticized you uh flourished and (119m 9s) loved for time the imagenet the famed (119m 11s) image in that data set and I've recently (119m 14s) had some words uh of criticism that the (119m 18s) academic research ml Community gives a (119m 20s) little too much love still to the (119m 22s) imagenet or like those kinds of (119m 24s) benchmarks can you speak to the (119m 25s) strengths and weaknesses of data sets (119m 29s) used in machine learning research (119m 31s) actually I don't know that I recall the (119m 34s) specific instance where I was uh unhappy (119m 35s) or criticizing imagenet I think imagenet (119m 38s) has been extremely valuable uh it was (119m 41s) basically a benchmark that allowed the (119m 43s) Deep Learning Community to demonstrate (119m 44s) that deep neural networks actually work (119m 47s) it was uh there's a massive value in (119m 50s) that um so I think imagenet was useful (119m 52s) but um basically it's become a bit of an (119m 55s) eminist at this point so eminist is like (119m 57s) the 228 by 28 grayscale digits there's (119m 58s) kind of a joke data set that everyone (120m 1s) like just crushes if there's no Papers (120m 3s) written on MNS though right maybe they (120m 5s) should have strong papers like papers (120m 7s) that focus on like how do we learn with (120m 8s) a small amount of data that kind of (120m 10s) stuff yeah I could see that being (120m 11s) helpful but not in sort of like Mainline (120m 12s) computer vision research anymore of (120m 14s) course I think the way I've heard you (120m 16s) somewhere maybe I'm just imagining (120m 18s) things but I think you said like image (120m 19s) that was a huge contribution to the (120m 20s) community for a long time and now it's (120m 23s) time to move past those kinds of well (120m 24s) image that has been crushed I mean you (120m 26s) know the error rates are (120m 27s) uh (120m 30s) yeah we're getting like 90 accuracy in (120m 33s) in one thousand classification way uh (120m 36s) prediction and I've seen those images (120m 39s) and it's like really high that's really (120m 40s) that's really good if I remember (120m 42s) correctly the top five error rate is now (120m 44s) like one percent or something given your (120m 47s) experience with a gigantic real world (120m 48s) data set would you like to see (120m 50s) benchmarks move in certain directions (120m 51s) that the research Community uses (120m 53s) unfortunately I don't think academics (120m 55s) currently have the next imagenet uh (120m 57s) We've obviously I think we've crushed (120m 58s) mnist we've basically kind of crushed (121m 1s) imagenet uh and there's no next sort of (121m 2s) big Benchmark that the entire Community (121m 5s) rallies behind and uses (121m 5s) um (121m 8s) you know for further development of (121m 9s) these networks uh yeah what it takes for (121m 12s) data set to Captivate the imagination of (121m 13s) everybody like where they all get behind (121m 17s) it that that could also need like a (121m 18s) viral like a leader right you know (121m 20s) somebody with popularity I mean that (121m 23s) yeah why did image of that take off (121m 26s) is there or is it just the accident of (121m 27s) History it was the right amount of (121m 30s) difficult uh it was the right amount of (121m 32s) difficult and simple and uh interesting (121m 34s) enough it just kind of like it was it (121m 35s) was the right time for that kind of a (121m 36s) data set (121m 39s) question from Reddit (121m 42s) uh what are your thoughts on the role (121m 44s) that synthetic data and game engines (121m 45s) will play in the future of neural net (121m 47s) model development (121m 48s) I think (121m 52s) um as neural Nets converge to humans (121m 55s) uh the value of simulation to neural (121m 56s) Nets will be similar to value of (121m 58s) simulation to humans (122m 1s) so people use simulation for uh (122m 3s) people use simulation because they can (122m 5s) learn something in that kind of a system (122m 7s) and without having to actually (122m 9s) experience it (122m 10s) um but are you referring to the (122m 12s) simulation we're doing our head no sorry (122m 14s) simulation I mean like video games or uh (122m 18s) you know other forms of simulation for (122m 20s) various professionals well so let me (122m 21s) push back on that because maybe their (122m 23s) simulation that we do in our heads like (122m 26s) simulate if I do this (122m 28s) what do I think will happen Okay that's (122m 30s) like internal simulation yeah internal (122m 31s) isn't that what we're doing let's (122m 33s) assuming before we act oh yeah but (122m 35s) that's independent from like the use of (122m 35s) uh simulation in the sense of like (122m 38s) computer games or using simulation for (122m 40s) training set creation or you know is it (122m 41s) independent or is it just Loosely (122m 43s) correlated because like uh (122m 47s) isn't that useful to do like um (122m 49s) counterfactual or like Edge case (122m 51s) simulation to like (122m 52s) you know what happens if there's a (122m 53s) nuclear war (122m 56s) what happens if there's you know like (122m 58s) those kinds of things yeah that's a (122m 59s) different simulation from like Unreal (123m 1s) Engine that's how I interpreted the (123m 3s) question uh so like (123m 5s) simulation of the average case (123m 8s) is that what's Unreal Engine what what (123m 11s) what what what do you mean by Unreal (123m 13s) Engine so (123m 15s) simulating a world yeah physics of that (123m 17s) world (123m 18s) why is that different like because you (123m 21s) also can add Behavior to that world and (123m 23s) you can try all kinds of stuff right (123m 25s) like you could throw all kinds of weird (123m 27s) things into it so Unreal Engine is not (123m 30s) just about similar I mean I guess it is (123m 31s) about submitting the physics of the (123m 33s) world it's also doing something with (123m 35s) that (123m 36s)\",\n",
       " \"yeah the graphics the physics and the (123m 38s) Agents that you put into the environment (123m 40s) and stuff like that yeah see I think you (123m 41s) I feel like you said that it's not that (123m 44s) important I guess for the future of AI (123m 47s) development is that is that correct to (123m 49s) interpret you that way uh I think (123m 51s) humans use uh simulators (123m 54s) for um humans use simulators and they (123m 56s) find them useful and so computers will (123m 58s) use simulators and find them useful (124m 0s) okay so you're saying it's not I I don't (124m 1s) use simulators very often I play a video (124m 3s) game every once in a while but I don't (124m 6s) think I derive any wisdom about my own (124m 8s) existence from from those video games (124m 11s) it's a momentary escape from reality (124m 13s) versus a source of wisdom about reality (124m 15s) so I don't so I think that's a very (124m 17s) polite way of saying simulation is not (124m 19s) that useful (124m 21s) yeah maybe maybe not I don't see it as (124m 24s) like a fundamental really important part (124m 25s) of like training neural Nets currently (124m 28s) uh but I think uh as neural Nets become (124m 30s) more and more powerful I think you will (124m 32s) need fewer examples to train additional (124m 35s) behaviors and uh simulation is of course (124m 37s) there's a domain Gap in a simulation (124m 38s) that's not the real world there's (124m 41s) slightly something different but uh with (124m 43s) a powerful enough neural net uh you need (124m 45s) um The Domain Gap can be bigger I think (124m 46s) because neural network will sort of (124m 47s) understand that even though it's not the (124m 49s) real world it like has all this high (124m 51s) level structure that I'm supposed to be (124m 52s) able to learn from so then you'll know (124m 53s) we'll actually (124m 57s) yeah you'll be able to Leverage (125m 0s) the synthetic data better yes by closing (125m 2s) the get better understanding in which (125m 5s) ways this is not real data exactly (125m 7s) uh right to do better questions next (125m 9s) time that was that was a question but (125m 12s) I'm just kidding all right um (125m 12s) so is it possible do you think speaking (125m 18s) of feminist to construct neural Nets and (125m 19s) training processes that require very (125m 21s) little data (125m 24s) so we've been talking about huge data (125m 26s) sets like the internet for training I (125m 28s) mean one way to say that is like you (125m 29s) said like the querying itself is another (125m 32s) level of training I guess and that (125m 35s) requires a little data yeah but do you (125m 38s) see any uh value in doing research and (125m 41s) kind of going down the direction of can (125m 44s) we use very little data to train to (125m 46s) construct a knowledge base 100 I just (125m 47s) think like at some point you need a (125m 48s) massive data set and then when you (125m 51s) pre-train your massive neural nut and (125m 52s) get something that you know is like a (125m 54s) GPT or something then you're able to be (125m 57s) very efficient at training any arbitrary (126m 1s) new task uh so a lot of these gpts you (126m 2s) know you can do tasks like sentiment (126m 4s) analysis or translation or so on just by (126m 6s) being prompted with very few examples (126m 7s) here's the kind of thing I want you to (126m 9s) do like here's an input sentence here's (126m 11s) the translation into German input (126m 13s) sentence translation to German input (126m 14s) sentence blank and the neural network (126m 16s) will complete the translation to German (126m 18s) just by looking at sort of the example (126m 19s) you've provided and so that's an example (126m 23s) of a very few shot uh learning in the (126m 24s) activations of the neural net instead of (126m 26s) the weights of the neural land and so I (126m 27s) think (126m 29s) basically uh just like humans neural (126m 31s) Nets will become very data efficient at (126m 34s) learning any other new task but at some (126m 35s) point you need a massive data set to (126m 37s) pre-train your network (126m 39s) to get that and probably we humans have (126m 41s) something like that do we do we have (126m 44s) something like that do we have a passive (126m 46s) in the background (126m 50s) background model constructing thing that (126m 51s) just runs all the time in a (126m 53s) self-supervised way we're not conscious (126m 55s) of it I think humans definitely I mean (126m 56s) obviously we have uh we learn a lot (127m 0s) during during our life span but also we (127m 2s) have a ton of Hardware that helps us (127m 3s) initialize initialization coming from (127m 6s) sort of evolution and so I think that's (127m 8s) also a really big a big component a lot (127m 9s) of people in the field I think they just (127m 11s) talk about the amounts of like seconds (127m 13s) and the you know that a person has lived (127m 15s) pretending that this is a table arasa (127m 17s) sort of like a zero initialization of a (127m 20s) neural net and it's not like you can (127m 20s) look at a lot of animals like for (127m 24s) example zebras zebras get born and they (127m 27s) see and they can run there's zero train (127m 29s) data in their lifespan they can just do (127m 32s) that so somehow I have no idea how (127m 34s) Evolution has found a way to encode (127m 35s) these algorithms and these neural net (127m 37s) initializations are extremely good to 80 (127m 39s) CGS and I have no idea how this works (127m 41s) but apparently it's possible because (127m 44s) here's a proof by existence there's (127m 47s) something magical about going from a (127m 48s) single cell to an organism that is born (127m 51s) to the first few years of life I kind of (127m 52s) like the idea that the reason we don't (127m 55s) remember anything about the first few (127m 57s) years of our life is that it's a really (127m 59s) painful process like it's a very (128m 1s) difficult challenging (128m 3s) training process yeah like (128m 6s) intellectually like (128m 9s) and maybe yeah I mean I don't why don't (128m 12s) we remember any of that there might be (128m 15s) some crazy training going on and the (128m 18s) that maybe that's the background model (128m 22s) training that uh is is very painful and (128m 24s) so it's best for the system once it's (128m 26s) trained not to remember how it's (128m 28s) constructed I think it's just like the (128m 29s) hardware for long-term memory is just (128m 31s) not fully developed sure I kind of feel (128m 34s) like the first few years of uh of (128m 36s) infants is not actually like learning (128m 38s) it's brain maturing yeah (128m 41s) um we're born premature (128m 42s) um and there's a theory along those (128m 44s) lines because of the birth canal and the (128m 45s) swelling of the brain and so we're born (128m 47s) premature and then the first few years (128m 49s) we're just the brains maturing and then (128m 51s) there's some learning eventually (128m 51s) um (128m 54s) it's my current view on it what do you (128m 56s) think do you think neural Nets can have (128m 58s) long-term memory (129m 1s) like that approach is something like (129m 2s) humans do you think you know do you (129m 4s) think there needs to be another meta (129m 6s) architecture on top of it to add (129m 7s) something like a knowledge base that (129m 9s) learns facts about the world and all (129m 11s) that kind of stuff yes but I don't know (129m 13s) to what extent it will be explicitly (129m 15s) constructed (129m 17s) um it might take unintuitive forms where (129m 20s) you are telling the GPT like hey you (129m 21s) have a you have a declarative memory (129m 23s) bank to which you can store and retrieve (129m 25s) data from and whenever you encounter (129m 27s) some information that you find useful (129m 29s) just save it to your memory bank and (129m 30s) here's an example of something you have (129m 33s) retrieved and Heiser how you say it and (129m 34s) here's how you load from it you just say (129m 37s) load whatever you teach it in text in (129m 40s) English and then it might learn to use a (129m 43s) memory bank from from that oh so so the (129m 45s) neural net is the architecture for the (129m 48s) background model the the base thing and (129m 49s) then yeah everything else is just on top (129m 51s) of this it's not just a text right it's (129m 53s) you're giving it gadgets and gizmos so (129m 54s) uh you're teaching in some kind of a (129m 56s) special Language by which we can it can (129m 58s) save arbitrary information and retrieve (130m 0s) it at a later time and you're telling (130m 1s) about these special tokens and how to (130m 3s) arrange them to use these interfaces (130m 5s) it's like hey you can use a calculator (130m 8s) here's how you use it just do five three (130m 11s) plus four one equals and when equals is (130m 13s) there uh a calculator will actually read (130m 14s) out the answer and you don't have to (130m 17s) calculate it yourself and you just like (130m 18s) tell it in English this might actually (130m 21s) work do you think in that sense gato is (130m 22s) interesting the the Deep Mind system (130m 24s) that it's not just new language but (130m 26s) actually throws it all (130m 31s) uh in the same pile images actions all (130m 32s) that kind of stuff that's basically what (130m 34s) we're moving towards yeah I think so so (130m 36s) gato is uh is very much a kitchen sink (130m 38s) approach to like (130m 41s) um reinforcement learning lots of (130m 42s) different environments with a single (130m 45s) fixed Transformer model right (130m 47s) um I think it's a very sort of early (130m 50s) result in that in that realm but I think (130m 51s) uh yeah it's along the lines of what I (130m 52s) think things will eventually look like (130m 55s) right so this is the early days of a (130m 56s) system that eventually will look like (130m 58s) this like from a rigid Rich sudden (131m 1s) perspective yeah I'm not super huge fan (131m 2s) of I think all these interfaces that (131m 4s) like look very different (131m 5s) um I would want everything to be (131m 6s) normalized into the same API so for (131m 9s) example it's green pixels versus same (131m 10s) API instead of having like different (131m 11s) world environments at a very different (131m 14s) physics and Joint configurations and (131m 15s) appearances and whatever and you're (131m 16s) having some kind of special tokens for (131m 20s) different games that you can plug I'd (131m 21s) rather just normalize everything to a (131m 23s) single interface so it looks the same to (131m 24s) the neural net if that makes sense so (131m 26s) it's all going to be pixel based pong in (131m 29s) the end I think so (131m 29s) okay uh let me ask you about your own (131m 35s) personal life (131m 37s) a lot of people want to know you're one (131m 37s) of the most productive and brilliant (131m 40s) people in the history of AI what is a (131m 41s) productive day in the life of Andre (131m 43s) capathi look like (131m 47s) what time do you wake up because imagine (131m 49s) um some kind of dance between the (131m 50s) average productive day and a perfect (131m 52s) productive day so the perfect productive (131m 54s) day is the thing we strive (131m 56s) towards in the average is kind of what (131m 58s) it kind of converges to getting all the (132m 1s) mistakes and human eventualities and so (132m 2s) on yeah so what times you wake up are (132m 4s) you morning person I'm not a morning (132m 7s) person I'm a night owl for sure I think (132m 10s) stable or not that's semi-stable like a (132m 11s) eight or nine or something like that (132m 14s) during my PhD it was even later I used (132m 17s) to go to sleep usually at 3am I think uh (132m 19s) the am hours are are precious and very (132m 20s) interesting time to work because (132m 22s) everyone is asleep (132m 24s) um at 8 AM or 7 A.M the east coast is (132m 27s) awake so there's already activity (132m 28s) there's already some text messages (132m 29s) whatever there's stuff happening you can (132m 31s) go in like some news website and there's (132m 34s) stuff happening it's distracting uh at (132m 36s) 3am everything is totally quiet and so (132m 37s) you're not going to be bothered and you (132m 38s) have solid chunks of time to do your (132m 41s) work (132m 43s) um so I like those periods Night Owl by (132m 46s) default and then I think like productive (132m 47s) time basically (132m 49s) um what I like to do is you need you (132m 51s) need to like build some momentum on the (132m 53s) problem without too much distraction and (132m 58s) um you need to load your Ram uh your (132m 59s) working memory with that problem (133m 1s) and then you need to be obsessed with it (133m 2s) when you're taking shower when you're (133m 4s) falling asleep you need to be obsessed (133m 5s) with the problem and it's fully in your (133m 7s) memory and you're ready to wake up and (133m 9s) work on it right there so there's a (133m 12s) scale of uh is this in a scale temporal (133m 13s) scale of a single day or a couple of (133m 15s) days a week a month so I can't talk (133m 16s) about one day basically in isolation (133m 19s) because it's a whole process when I want (133m 20s) to get when I want to get productive in (133m 22s) the problem I feel like I need a span of (133m 25s) a few days where I can really get in on (133m 26s) that problem and I don't want to be (133m 29s) interrupted and I'm going to just uh be (133m 30s) completely obsessed with that problem (133m 32s) and that's where I do most of my good (133m 33s) workouts (133m 35s) you've done a bunch of cool like little (133m 36s) projects in a very short amount of time (133m 38s) very quickly so that that requires you (133m 40s) just focusing on it yeah basically I (133m 42s) need to load my working memory with the (133m 43s) problem and I need to be productive (133m 45s) because there's always like a huge fixed (133m 48s) cost to approaching any problem uh you (133m 49s) know like I was struggling with this for (133m 52s) example at Tesla because I want to work (133m 53s) on like small side projects but okay you (133m 55s) first need to figure out okay I need to (133m 57s) SSH into my cluster I need to bring up a (133m 58s) vs code editor so I can like work on (134m 1s) this I need to I run into some stupid (134m 3s) error because of some reason like you're (134m 4s) not at a point where you can be just (134m 6s) productive right away you are facing (134m 9s) barriers and so it's about uh really (134m 11s) removing all that barrier and you're (134m 13s) able to go into the problem and you have (134m 14s) the full problem loaded in your memory (134m 16s) and somehow avoiding distractions of all (134m 20s) different forms like uh news stories (134m 23s) emails but also distractions from other (134m 25s) interesting projects that you previously (134m 26s) worked on are currently working on and (134m 28s) so on you just want to really focus your (134m 30s) mind and I mean I can take some time off (134m 33s) for distractions and in between but I (134m 35s) think it can't be too much uh you know (134m 36s) most of your day is sort of like spent (134m 39s) on that problem and then you know I (134m 42s) drink coffee I have my morning routine I (134m 44s) look at some news uh Twitter Hacker News (134m 46s) Wall Street Journal Etc (134m 48s) so basically you wake up you have some (134m 50s) coffee are you trying to get to work as (134m 52s) quickly as possible do you do taking (134m 54s) this diet of of like what the hell's (134m 57s) happening in the world first I am I do (134m 59s) find it interesting to know about the (135m 1s) world I don't know that it's useful or (135m 2s) good but it is part of my routine right (135m 4s) now so I do read through a bunch of news (135m 7s) articles and I want to be informed and (135m 9s) um I'm suspicious of it I'm suspicious (135m 11s) of the practice but currently that's (135m 13s) where I am Oh you mean suspicious about (135m 15s) the positive effect yeah of that (135m 18s) practice on your productivity and your (135m 19s) well-being my well-being psychologically (135m 22s) uh and also on your ability to deeply (135m 24s) understand the world because how there's (135m 25s) a bunch of sources of information you're (135m 28s) not really focused on deeply integrating (135m 29s) yeah it's a little bit distracting or (135m 32s) yeah in terms of a perfectly productive (135m 36s) day for how long of a stretch of time (135m 38s) in one session do you try to work and (135m 40s) focus on a thing it's a couple hours is (135m 42s) it one hours or 30 minutes is 10 minutes (135m 44s) I can probably go like a small few hours (135m 46s) and then I need some breaks in between (135m 49s) for like food and stuff and uh (135m 51s) yeah but I think like uh it's still (135m 53s) really hard to accumulate hours I was (135m 55s) using a Tracker that told me exactly how (135m 56s) much time I've spent coding any one day (135m 58s) and even on a very productive day I (135m 59s) still spent only like six or eight hours (136m 1s) yeah and it's just because there's so (136m 5s) much padding commute talking to people (136m 8s) food Etc there's like the cost of life (136m 11s) just living and sustaining and (136m 12s) homeostasis and just maintaining (136m 16s) yourself as a human is very high and and (136m 18s) there seems to be a desire within the (136m 21s) human mind to to uh to participate in (136m 23s) society that creates that padding yeah (136m 25s) because I yeah the most productive days (136m 27s) I've ever had is just completely from (136m 28s) start to finish just tuning out (136m 30s) everything yep and just sitting there (136m 33s) and then and then you could do more than (136m 34s) six and eight hours yeah is there some (136m 36s) wisdom about what gives you strength to (136m 39s) do like uh tough days of long Focus (136m 41s) yeah just like whenever I get obsessed (136m 43s) about a problem something just needs to (136m 45s) work something just needs to exist it (136m 47s) needs to exist and you so you're able to (136m 49s) deal with bugs and programming issues (136m 51s) and technical issues and uh design (136m 53s) decisions that turn out to be the wrong (136m 55s) ones you're able to think through all of (136m 57s) that given given that you want to think (136m 58s) to exist yeah it needs to exist and then (137m 0s) I think to me also a big factor is uh (137m 1s) you know are other humans are going to (137m 3s) appreciate it are they going to like it (137m 5s) that's a big part of my motivation if (137m 6s) I'm helping humans and they seem happy (137m 10s) they say nice things uh they tweet about (137m 11s) it or whatever that gives me pleasure (137m 13s) because I'm doing something useful so (137m 16s) like you do see yourself sharing it with (137m 18s) the world like with yes on GitHub with a (137m 19s) blog post or through videos yeah I was (137m 21s) thinking about it like suppose I did all (137m 23s) these things but did not share them I (137m 23s) don't think I would have the same amount (137m 25s) of motivation that I can build up you (137m 28s) enjoy the feeling of other people (137m 31s) uh gaining value and happiness from the (137m 33s) stuff you've created yeah (137m 35s) uh what about diet (137m 37s) is there I saw you playing with in (137m 39s) intermittent fast do you fast does that (137m 40s) help with everything (137m 42s) well the things you played what's been (137m 46s) most beneficial to the your ability to (137m 48s) mentally focus on a thing and just meant (137m 50s) the mental productivity and happiness (137m 52s) you still fast yeah it's so fast but I (137m 54s) do intermittent fasting but really what (137m 56s) it means at the end of the day is I skip (137m 58s) breakfast yeah so I do uh 18 6 roughly (138m 0s) by default when I'm in my steady state (138m 2s) if I'm traveling or doing something else (138m 3s) I will break the rules but in my steady (138m 6s) state I do 18 6 so I eat only from 12 to (138m 9s) 6. not a hard Rule and I break it often (138m 11s) but that's my default and then um yeah (138m 13s) I've done a bunch of random experiments (138m 15s) for the most part right now uh where (138m 16s) I've been for the last year and a half I (138m 19s) want to say is I'm um plant-based or (138m 21s) planned forward I heard plant forward it (138m 23s) sounds better exactly I didn't actually (138m 24s) know the differences but it sounds (138m 26s)\",\n",
       " \"better in my mind but it just means I (138m 28s) prefer plant-based food and raw or (138m 32s) cooked or I prefer cooked uh and blunt (138m 34s) paste so plant-based (138m 37s) oh forgive me I don't actually know how (138m 39s) wide the category of plant entails (138m 43s) Wellness just means that you're not uh (138m 46s) and you can flex and uh you just prefer (138m 48s) to eat plants and you know you're not (138m 49s) making you're not trying to influence (138m 51s) other people and if someone is you come (138m 53s) to someone's house party and they serve (138m 54s) you a stake that they're really proud of (138m 56s) you will eat it yes right it's just not (138m 57s) judgment oh that's beautiful I mean (138m 59s) that's (139m 0s) um on the flip side of that but I'm very (139m 2s) sort of flexible have you tried doing (139m 6s) one meal a day uh I have uh accidentally (139m 8s) not consistently but I've accidentally (139m 10s) had that I don't I don't like it I think (139m 12s) it makes me feel uh not good it's too (139m 14s) it's too much too much of a hit yeah and (139m 17s) uh So currently I have about two meals a (139m 19s) day 12 and six I do that non-stop I'm (139m 22s) doing it now I'm doing one meal a day (139m 23s) okay so it's interesting it's a (139m 25s) interesting feeling have you ever fasted (139m 27s) longer than a day yeah I've done a bunch (139m 28s) of water fasts because I was curious (139m 31s) what happens uh anything interesting (139m 33s) yeah I would say so I mean you know (139m 34s) what's interesting is that you're hungry (139m 36s) for two days and then starting day three (139m 40s) or so you're not hungry it's like such a (139m 40s) weird feeling because you haven't eaten (139m 42s) in a few days and you're not hungry (139m 44s) isn't that weird it's really one of the (139m 47s) many weird things about human biology is (139m 48s) figure something out it finds finds (139m 50s) another source of energy or something (139m 53s) like that or uh relaxes the system I (139m 54s) don't know how yeah the body is like (139m 56s) you're hungry you're hungry and then it (139m 57s) just gives up it's like okay I guess (139m 59s) we're fasting now there's nothing and (140m 0s) then it just kind of like focuses on (140m 3s) trying to make you not hungry uh and you (140m 5s) know not feel the the damage of that and (140m 7s) uh trying to give you some space to (140m 9s) figure out the food situation (140m 11s) so are you still to this day most (140m 15s) productive uh at night I would say I am (140m 17s) but it is really hard to maintain my PhD (140m 18s) schedule (140m 21s) um especially when I was say working at (140m 23s) Tesla and so on it's a non-starter so (140m 24s) but even now like you know people want (140m 25s) to meet for (140m 29s) various events they Society lives in a (140m 30s) certain period of time and you sort of (140m 32s) have to like work so that's it's hard to (140m 34s) like do a social thing and then after (140m 37s) that return and do work yeah it's just (140m 38s) really hard (140m 41s) uh that's why I try to do social things (140m 43s) I try not to do too uh too much drinking (140m 47s) so I can return and continue doing work (140m 49s) um but a Tesla is there is there (140m 52s) conversions in Tesla but any any company (140m 55s) is there a convergence towards the (140m 57s) schedule or is there more (140m 59s) is that how humans behave when they (141m 1s) collaborate I need to learn about this (141m 3s) yeah do they try to keep a consistent (141m 4s) schedule you're all awake at the same (141m 6s) time I mean I do try to create a routine (141m 8s) and I try to create a steady state in (141m 11s) which I'm uh comfortable in uh so I have (141m 13s) a morning routine I have a day routine I (141m 14s) try to keep things to do a steady state (141m 17s) and um things are predictable and then (141m 19s) you can sort of just like your body just (141m 21s) sort of like sticks to that and if you (141m 21s) try to stress that a little too much it (141m 23s) will create uh you know when you're (141m 24s) traveling and you're dealing with jet (141m 27s) lag you're not able to really Ascend to (141m 30s) you know where you need to go yeah yeah (141m 32s) that's weird as humans with the habits (141m 33s) and stuff uh what are your thoughts on (141m 35s) work-life balance throughout a human (141m 38s) lifetime (141m 40s) so the testing part was known for sort (141m 43s) of pushing people to their limits (141m 45s) in terms of what they're able to do in (141m 47s) terms of what they're uh trying to do in (141m 49s) terms of how much they work all that (141m 51s) kind of stuff yeah I mean I will say (141m 54s) teslaq is still too much uh bad rep for (141m 56s) this because what's happening is Tesla (141m 58s) is a it's a bursting environment uh so I (142m 0s) would say the Baseline uh my only point (142m 1s) of reference is Google where I've (142m 3s) interned three times and I saw what it's (142m 6s) like inside Google and and deepmind (142m 8s) um I would say the Baseline is higher (142m 9s) than that but then there's a punctuated (142m 11s) equilibrium where once in a while (142m 12s) there's a fire and uh someone like (142m 15s) people work really hard and so it's (142m 17s) spiky and bursty and then all the (142m 18s) stories get collected about the bursts (142m 20s) yeah and then it gives the appearance of (142m 22s) like total insanity but actually it's (142m 24s) just a bit more intense environment and (142m 27s) there are fires and Sprints and so I (142m 28s) think uh you know definitely though I I (142m 29s) would say (142m 31s) um it's a more intense environment than (142m 33s) something you would get but you in your (142m 35s) person forget all of that just in your (142m 36s) own personal life (142m 38s) um what do you think about (142m 40s) the happiness of a human being a (142m 43s) brilliant person like yourself (142m 46s) about finding a balance between work and (142m 49s) life or is it such a thing not a good (142m 51s) thought experiment (142m 54s) yeah I think I think balance is good but (142m 56s) I also love to have Sprints that are out (142m 58s) of distribution and that's what I think (143m 2s) I've been pretty uh creative and (143m 5s) um as well Sprints out of distribution (143m 7s) means that most of the time (143m 11s) you have a yeah quote-unquote balance I (143m 12s) have balance most of the time yes I like (143m 14s) being obsessed with something once in a (143m 16s) while once in a while is what once a (143m 18s) week once a month once a year yeah (143m 19s) probably like say once a month or (143m 21s) something yeah and that's when we get a (143m 22s) new GitHub repo come on yeah that's when (143m 24s) you like really care about a problem it (143m 26s) must exist this will be awesome you're (143m 28s) obsessed with it and now you can't just (143m 30s) do it on that day you need to pay the (143m 32s) fixed cost of getting into the groove (143m 33s) and then you need to stay there for a (143m 35s) while and then Society will come and (143m 37s) they will try to mess with you and they (143m 37s) will try to distract you yeah yeah the (143m 39s) worst thing is like a person who's like (143m 40s) I just need five minutes of your time (143m 44s) yeah this is the cost of that is not (143m 46s) five minutes and Society needs to change (143m 48s) how it thinks about just five minutes of (143m 51s) your time right it's never it's never (143m 54s) just one minute it's just 30 it's just a (143m 55s) quick what's the big deal why are you (143m 57s) being so yeah no (144m 1s) uh what's your computer setup what uh (144m 3s) what's like the perfect are you somebody (144m 5s) that's flexible to no matter what laptop (144m 10s) four screens yeah uh or do you uh prefer (144m 12s) a certain setup that you're most (144m 13s) productive um I guess the one that I'm (144m 17s) familiar with is one large screen uh 27 (144m 18s) inch (144m 20s) um and my laptop on the side with (144m 22s) operating system I do Max that's my (144m 25s) primary for all tasks I would say OS X (144m 26s) but when you're working on deep learning (144m 27s) everything as Linux your SSH into a (144m 31s) cluster and you're working remotely but (144m 31s) what about the actual development like (144m 34s) that using the IDE yeah you would use uh (144m 36s) I think a good way is you just run vs (144m 38s) code (144m 39s) um my favorite editor right now on your (144m 41s) Mac but you are actually you have a (144m 43s) remote folder through SSH (144m 45s) um so the actual files that you're (144m 46s) manipulating are on the cluster (144m 49s) somewhere else so what's the best IDE (144m 53s) uh vs code what else do people so I use (144m 57s) emacs still that's cool uh so it may be (144m 59s) cool I don't know if it's maximum (145m 1s) productivity (145m 2s) um so what what do you recommend in (145m 4s) terms of editors you worked with a lot (145m 7s) of software Engineers editors for (145m 9s) python C plus plus machine learning (145m 11s) applications I think the current answer (145m 14s) is vs code currently I believe that's (145m 15s) the best (145m 17s) um IDE it's got a huge amount of (145m 19s) extensions it has a GitHub co-pilot (145m 22s) um uh integration which I think is very (145m 24s) valuable what do you think about the the (145m 26s) co-pilot integration I was actually uh I (145m 27s) got to talk a bunch with Guido and (145m 29s) Rossum who's a creative Python and he (145m 33s) loves Coppola he like he programs a lot (145m 35s) with it yeah uh do you (145m 38s) yeah he's copilot I love it and uh it's (145m 40s) free for me but I would pay for it yeah (145m 41s) I think it's very good and the utility (145m 43s) that I found with it was is in is it I (145m 45s) would say there is a learning curve and (145m 47s) you need to figure out when it's helpful (145m 49s) and when to pay attention to its outputs (145m 50s) and when it's not going to be helpful (145m 52s) where you should not pay attention to it (145m 54s) because if you're just reading its (145m 54s) suggestions all the time it's not a good (145m 56s) way of interacting with it but I think I (145m 58s) was able to sort of like mold myself to (146m 0s) it I find it's very helpful number one (146m 2s) in copy paste and replace some parts so (146m 5s) I don't um when the pattern is clear (146m 6s) it's really good at completing the (146m 8s) pattern and number two sometimes it (146m 10s) suggests apis that I'm not aware of so (146m 13s) it tells you about something that you (146m 14s) didn't know so and that's an opportunity (146m 16s) to discover and you it's an opportunity (146m 18s) to see I would never take copilot code (146m 20s) AS given I almost always uh copy a copy (146m 23s) this into a Google Search and you see (146m 24s) what this function is doing and then (146m 25s) you're like oh it's actually actually (146m 27s) exactly what I need thank you copilot so (146m 28s) you learned something so it's in part a (146m 31s) search engine apart maybe getting the (146m 34s) exact syntax correctly that once you see (146m 36s) it yep it's that NP hard thing it's like (146m 38s) once you see it you know yes exactly (146m 41s) correct exactly you yourself you can (146m 43s) struggle you can verify efficiently but (146m 45s) you you can't generate efficiently and (146m 46s) copilot really I mean it's it's (146m 49s) autopilot for programming right and (146m 51s) currently it's doing the link following (146m 52s) which is like the simple copy paste and (146m 54s) sometimes suggest uh but over time it's (146m 56s) going to become more and more autonomous (146m 59s) and so the same thing will play out in (147m 1s) not just coding but actually across many (147m 2s) many different things probably but (147m 4s) coding is an important one right like (147m 6s) writing programs yeah what how do you (147m 8s) see the future of that developing uh the (147m 10s) program synthesis like being able to (147m 11s) write programs that are more and more (147m 14s) complicated because right now it's human (147m 18s) supervised in interesting ways yes like (147m 20s) what it feels like the transition will (147m 21s) be very painful (147m 23s) my mental model for it is the same thing (147m 25s) will happen as with the autopilot uh So (147m 27s) currently it's doing link following is (147m 29s) doing some simple stuff and eventually (147m 31s) we'll be doing autonomy and people will (147m 33s) have to intervene less and less and (147m 34s) there could be like you like testing (147m 36s) mechanisms (147m 38s) like if it writes a function and that (147m 41s) function looks pretty damn correct but (147m 43s) how do you know it's correct because (147m 44s) you're like getting lazier and lazier as (147m 46s) a programmer like your ability to (147m 49s) because like little bugs but I guess it (147m 51s) won't make a little no it will it (147m 54s) copilot will make uh off by one subtle (147m 55s) bugs it has done that to me but do you (147m 58s) think future systems will or is it (148m 0s) really the off by one is actually a (148m 2s) fundamental challenge of programming in (148m 4s) that case it wasn't fundamental and I (148m 6s) think things can improve but uh yeah I (148m 8s) think humans have to supervise I am (148m 9s) nervous about people not supervising (148m 11s) what comes out and what happens to for (148m 14s) example the proliferation of bugs in all (148m 15s) of our systems I'm nervous about that (148m 17s) but I think and there will probably be (148m 19s) some other copilots for bug finding and (148m 21s) stuff like that at some point because (148m 21s) there will be like a lot more automation (148m 24s) for uh oh man (148m 28s) so it's like a program a co-pilot that (148m 31s) generates a compiler for one that does a (148m 33s) linter yes one that does like a a type (148m 36s) Checker yes (148m 39s) it's a committee of like a GPT sort of (148m 41s) like and then they'll be like a manager (148m 43s) for the committee yeah and then there'll (148m 44s) be somebody that says a new version of (148m 46s) this is needed we need to regenerate it (148m 48s) yeah there were 10 gpts that were (148m 49s) forwarded and gave 50 suggestions (148m 51s) another one looked at it and picked a (148m 53s) few that they like a bug one looked at (148m 54s) it and it was like it's probably a bug (148m 57s) they got re-ranked by some other thing (148m 59s) and then a final Ensemble uh GPT comes (149m 1s) in it's like okay given everything you (149m 2s) guys have told me this is probably the (149m 4s) next token you know the feeling is the (149m 5s) number of programmers in the world has (149m 8s) been growing and growing very quickly do (149m 9s) you think it's possible that it'll (149m 12s) actually level out and drop to like a (149m 13s) very low number with this kind of world (149m 15s) because then you'll be doing software (149m 18s) 2.0 programming (149m 21s) um and you'll be doing this kind of (149m 23s) generation of copilot type systems (149m 25s) programming but you won't be doing the (149m 27s) old school (149m 30s) software 1.0 program I don't currently (149m 31s) think that they're just going to replace (149m 33s) human programmers (149m 33s) um (149m 36s) it's I'm so hesitant saying stuff like (149m 38s) this right because this is going to be (149m 40s) replaced in five years I don't know it's (149m 43s) going to show that like this is where we (149m 46s) thought because I I agree with you but I (149m 47s) think we might be very surprised (149m 51s) right like what are the next (149m 53s) I I what's your sense of what we're (149m 55s) seeing with language models like does it (149m 57s) feel like the beginning or the middle or (149m 59s) the end the beginning 100 I think the (150m 0s) big question in my mind is for sure GPT (150m 2s) will be able to program quite well (150m 4s) competently and so on how do you steer (150m 5s) the system you still have to provide (150m 8s) some guidance to what you actually are (150m 9s) looking for and so how do you steer it (150m 12s) and how do you say how do you talk to it (150m 14s) how do you um (150m 15s) audit it and verify that what is done is (150m 17s) correct and how do you like work with (150m 19s) this and it's as much not just an AI (150m 22s) problem but a UI ux problem yeah (150m 25s) um so beautiful fertile ground for so (150m 27s) much interesting work for vs code plus (150m 29s) plus where you're not just it's not just (150m 31s) human programming anymore it's amazing (150m 33s) yeah so you're interacting with the (150m 35s) system so not just one prompt but it's (150m 37s) iterative prompting yeah you're trying (150m 39s) to figure out having a conversation with (150m 40s) the system yeah that actually I mean to (150m 42s) me that's super exciting to have a (150m 44s) conversation with the program I'm (150m 45s) writing (150m 46s) yeah maybe at some point uh you're just (150m 48s) conversing with it it's like okay here's (150m 50s) what I want to do actually this variable (150m 52s) maybe it's not even that low level as (150m 55s) variable but you can also Imagine like (150m 58s) can you translate this to c plus and (151m 0s) back to python yeah that already kind of (151m 1s) existence no but just like doing it as (151m 4s) part of the program experience like I (151m 6s) think I'd like to write this function in (151m 6s) C plus plus (151m 9s) or or like you just keep changing for (151m 11s) different uh different programs because (151m 13s) they're different syntax maybe I want to (151m 14s) convert this into a functional language (151m 17s) and so like you get to become (151m 20s) multilingual as a programmer and dance (151m 23s) back and forth efficiently yeah I mean I (151m 25s) think the UI ux of it though is like (151m 26s) still very hard to think through because (151m 28s) it's not just about writing code on a (151m 29s) page you have an entire developer (151m 31s) environment you have a bunch of hardware (151m 33s) on it uh you have some environmental (151m 35s) variables you have some scripts that are (151m 36s) running in the Chrome job like there's a (151m 38s) lot going on to like working with (151m 41s) computers and how do these uh systems (151m 43s) set up environment flags and work across (151m 45s) multiple machines and set up screen (151m 46s) sessions and automate different (151m 48s) processes like how all that works and (151m 50s) it's auditable by humans and so on is (151m 52s) like massive question at the moment (151m 55s) you've built archive sanity (151m 57s) what is archive and what is the future (151m 59s) of academic research publishing that you (152m 2s) would like to see so archive is This (152m 3s) pre-print Server so if you have a paper (152m 5s) you can submit it for publication to (152m 7s) journals or conferences and then wait (152m 9s) six months and then maybe get a decision (152m 11s) pass or fail or you can just upload it (152m 12s) to Archive (152m 14s) and then people can tweet about it three (152m 16s) minutes later and then everyone sees it (152m 18s) everyone reads it and everyone can (152m 20s) profit from it uh in their own ways you (152m 23s) can cite it and it has an official look (152m 25s) to it it feels like a pub like it feels (152m 27s) like a publication process yeah it feels (152m 28s) different than you if you just put in a (152m 30s) blog post oh yeah yeah I mean it's a (152m 33s) paper and usually the the bar is higher (152m 35s) for something that you would expect on (152m 36s) archive as opposed to and something you (152m 38s) would see in a blog post well the (152m 41s) culture created the bar because you (152m 42s) could probably yes host a pretty crappy (152m 44s) face for an archive (152m 46s) um so what's that make you feel like (152m 47s) what's that make you feel about peer (152m 50s) review so rigorous peer review by two (152m 54s) three experts versus the peer review of (152m 57s) the community right as it's written yeah (152m 59s) basically I think the community is very (153m 1s) well able to peer review things very (153m 4s) quickly on Twitter and I think maybe it (153m 5s) just has to do something with AI machine (153m 7s) learning field specifically though I (153m 8s) feel like things are more easily (153m 12s) auditable um and the verification is is (153m 14s) easier potentially than the verification (153m 15s) somewhere else so it's kind of like um (153m 17s) you can think of these uh scientific (153m 18s) Publications there's like little (153m 20s)\",\n",
       " \"blockchains where everyone's building on (153m 21s) each other's work and setting each other (153m 24s) and you sort of have ai which is kind of (153m 25s) like this much faster and loose (153m 29s) blockchain but then you have and any one (153m 30s) individual entry is like very um very (153m 32s) cheap to make and then you have other (153m 33s) fields where maybe that model doesn't (153m 36s) make as much sense (153m 38s) um and so I think in AI at least things (153m 40s) are pretty easily verifiable and so (153m 41s) that's why when people upload papers (153m 42s) they're a really good idea and so on (153m 44s) people can try it out like the next day (153m 47s) and they can be the final Arbiter (153m 48s) whether it works or not on their problem (153m 49s) and the whole thing just moves (153m 51s) significantly faster so I kind of feel (153m 54s) like Academia still has a place sorry (153m 55s) this like conference Journal process (153m 56s) still has a place but it's sort of like (153m 59s) an um it lags behind I think and it's a (154m 2s) bit more maybe higher quality process (154m 4s) but it's not sort of the place where you (154m 6s) will discover Cutting Edge work anymore (154m 8s) yeah it used to be the case when I was (154m 8s) starting my PhD that you go to (154m 11s) conferences and journals and you discuss (154m 12s) all the latest research now when you go (154m 14s) to a conference or Journal like no one (154m 16s) discusses anything that's there because (154m 17s) it's already like three generations ago (154m 20s) irrelevant yes which makes me sad about (154m 22s) like deepmind for example where they (154m 24s) they still they still publish in nature (154m 27s) and these big prestigious I mean there's (154m 29s) still value as opposed to The Prestige (154m 31s) that comes with these big venues but the (154m 34s) the result is that they they'll announce (154m 36s) some breakthrough performance and it'll (154m 38s) take like a year to actually publish the (154m 42s) details I mean and those details in if (154m 43s) they were published immediately would (154m 45s) Inspire the community to move in certain (154m 47s) directions with that yeah it would speed (154m 48s) up the rest of the community but I don't (154m 50s) know to what extent that's part of their (154m 52s) objective function also that's true so (154m 53s) it's not just the prestige a little bit (154m 57s) of the delay is uh is part yeah they (154m 58s) certainly deepmind specifically has been (155m 1s) um working in the regime of having a (155m 2s) slightly higher quality basically (155m 4s) process and latency and uh publishing (155m 7s) those papers that way another question (155m 10s) from Reddit do you or have you suffered (155m 12s) from imposter syndrome being the (155m 16s) director of AI Tesla being this person (155m 18s) when you're at Stanford where like the (155m 20s) world looks at you as the expert in AI (155m 23s) to teach teach the world about machine (155m 26s) learning when I was leaving Tesla after (155m 28s) five years I spent a ton of time in (155m 30s) meeting rooms uh and you know I would (155m 32s) read papers in the beginning when I (155m 33s) joined Tesla I was writing code and then (155m 35s) I was writing lesson last code and I was (155m 36s) reading code and then I was reading (155m 38s) lesson less code and so this is just a (155m 39s) natural progression that happens I think (155m 41s) and uh definitely I would say near the (155m 43s) tail end that's when it sort of like (155m 44s) starts to hit you a bit more that you're (155m 46s) supposed to be an expert but actually (155m 47s) the source of Truth is the code that (155m 49s) people are writing the GitHub and the (155m 52s) actual the actual code itself and you're (155m 53s) not as familiar with that as you used to (155m 55s) be and so I would say maybe there's some (155m 56s) like insecurity there yeah that's (155m 59s) actually pretty profound that a lot of (156m 0s) the insecurity has to do with not (156m 1s) writing the code in the computer science (156m 4s) space like that because that is the (156m 5s) truth that that right there code is the (156m 7s) source of Truth the papers and (156m 8s) everything else it's a high level (156m 11s) summary I don't uh yeah just a high (156m 13s) level summary but at the end of the day (156m 13s) you have to read code it's impossible to (156m 16s) translate all that code into actual uh (156m 19s) you know paper form uh so when when (156m 20s) things come out especially when they (156m 21s) have a source code available that's my (156m 23s) favorite place to go so like I said (156m 25s) you're one of the greatest teachers of (156m 29s) machine learning AI ever uh from cs231n (156m 32s) to today what advice would you give to (156m 34s) beginners interested in getting into (156m 36s) machine learning (156m 39s) beginners are often focused on like what (156m 41s) to do and I think the focus should be (156m 44s) more like how much you do so I I'm kind (156m 45s) of like believer on a high level in this (156m 47s) 10 000 hours kind of concept where (156m 48s) you just kind of have to just pick the (156m 50s) things where you can spend time and you (156m 51s) you care about and you're interested in (156m 52s) you literally have to put in 10 000 (156m 54s) hours of work (156m 55s) um it doesn't even like matter as much (156m 57s) like where you put it and your you'll (156m 59s) iterate and you'll improve and you'll (157m 1s) waste some time I don't know if there's (157m 2s) a better way you need to put in 10 000 (157m 4s) hours but I think it's actually really (157m 4s) nice because I feel like there's some (157m 7s) sense of determinism about uh being an (157m 8s) expert at a thing if you spend ten (157m 10s) thousand hours you can literally pick an (157m 13s) arbitrary thing and I think if you spend (157m 14s) ten thousand hours of deliberate effort (157m 16s) and work you actually will become an (157m 18s) expert at it and so I think it's kind of (157m 20s) like a nice thought (157m 22s) um and so uh basically I would focus (157m 25s) more on like are you spending 10 000 (157m 27s) hours that's what I focus on so and then (157m 29s) thinking about what kind of mechanisms (157m 31s) maximize your likelihood of getting to (157m 33s) ten thousand dollars exactly which for (157m 36s) us silly humans means probably forming a (157m 39s) daily habit of like every single day (157m 40s) actually doing the thing whatever helps (157m 42s) you so I do think to a large extent is a (157m 43s) psychological problem for yourself uh (157m 45s) one other thing that I help that I think (157m 47s) is helpful for the psychology of it is (157m 49s) many times people compare themselves to (157m 51s) others in the area I think this is very (157m 52s) harmful only compare yourself to you (157m 55s) from some time ago like say a year ago (157m 57s) are you better than you year ago this is (157m 59s) the only way to think (158m 1s) um and I think this then you can see (158m 2s) your progress and it's very motivating (158m 5s) that's so interesting that focus on the (158m 8s) quantity of ours because I think a lot (158m 9s) of people uh in the beginner stage but (158m 12s) actually throughout get paralyzed (158m 16s) uh by uh the choice like which one do I (158m 18s) pick this path or this path yeah like (158m 21s) they'll literally get paralyzed by like (158m 22s) which ID to use well they're worried (158m 24s) yeah they're worried about all these (158m 26s) things but the thing is some of the you (158m 27s) you will waste time doing something (158m 28s) wrong yes you will eventually figure out (158m 29s) it's not right you will accumulate scar (158m 32s) tissue and next time you'll grow (158m 33s) stronger because next time you'll have (158m 36s) the scar tissue and next time you'll (158m 37s) learn from it and now next time you come (158m 39s) into a similar situation you'll be like (158m 40s) all right (158m 42s) I messed up I've spent a lot of time (158m 43s) working on things that never materialize (158m 45s) into anything and I have all that scar (158m 47s) tissue and I have some intuitions about (158m 49s) what was useful what wasn't useful how (158m 50s) things turned out uh so all those (158m 53s) mistakes were uh were not dead work you (158m 55s) know so I just think you should just (158m 57s) focus on working what have you done what (158m 59s) have you done last week (159m 1s) uh that's a good question actually to (159m 3s) ask for for a lot of things not just (159m 4s) machine learning (159m 7s) um it's a good way to cut the (159m 9s) the I forgot what the term will use but (159m 12s) the fluff the blubber whatever the uh (159m 14s) the inefficiencies in life uh what do (159m 17s) you love about teaching you seem to find (159m 19s) yourself (159m 21s) often in the like drawn to teaching (159m 22s) you're very good at it but you're also (159m 24s) drawn to it I mean I don't think I love (159m 28s) teaching I love happy humans and happy (159m 30s) humans like when I teach yes I I (159m 32s) wouldn't say I hate teaching I tolerate (159m 34s) teaching but it's not like the act of (159m 35s) teaching that I like it's it's that um (159m 38s) you know I I have some I have something (159m 41s) I'm actually okay at it yes I'm okay at (159m 43s) teaching and people appreciate it a lot (159m 46s) yeah and uh so I'm just happy to try to (159m 48s) be helpful and uh teaching itself is not (159m 50s) like the most I mean it's really it can (159m 52s) be really annoying frustrating I was (159m 54s) working on a bunch of lectures just now (159m 55s) I was reminded back to my days of 231 (159m 58s) and just how much work it is to create (159m 58s) some of these materials and make them (160m 1s) good the amount of iteration and thought (160m 2s) and you go down blind alleys and just (160m 4s) how much you change it so creating (160m 6s) something good (160m 8s) um in terms of like educational value is (160m 11s) really hard and uh it's not fun it's (160m 12s) difficult so for people should (160m 15s) definitely go watch your new stuff you (160m 16s) put out there are lectures where you're (160m 18s) actually building the thing like from (160m 20s) like you said the coldest truth so (160m 23s) discussing back propagation by building (160m 25s) it by looking through and just the whole (160m 27s) thing so how difficult is that to (160m 28s) prepare for I think that's a really (160m 30s) powerful way to teach how did you have (160m 32s) to prepare for that or are you just live (160m 34s) thinking through it I will typically do (160m 37s) like say three takes and then I take (160m 38s) like the the better take uh so I do (160m 40s) multiple takes and I take some of the (160m 41s) better takes and then I just build out a (160m 43s) lecture that way uh sometimes I have to (160m 45s) delete 30 minutes of content because it (160m 46s) just went down the Nelly that I didn't (160m 48s) like too much there's about a bunch of (160m 51s) iteration and it probably takes me you (160m 51s) know somewhere around 10 hours to create (160m 53s) one hour of content to give one hour (160m 56s) it's interesting I mean is it difficult (160m 58s) to go back to the like the basics do you (161m 1s) draw a lot of like wisdom from going (161m 2s) back to the basics yeah going back to (161m 4s) back propagation loss functions where (161m 5s) they come from and one thing I like (161m 7s) about teaching a lot honestly is it (161m 8s) definitely strengthens your (161m 11s) understanding uh so it's not a purely (161m 13s) altruistic activity it's a way to learn (161m 14s) if you have to explain something to (161m 17s) someone uh you realize you have gaps in (161m 20s) knowledge uh and so I even surprised (161m 23s) myself in those lectures like also the (161m 24s) result will obviously look at this and (161m 25s) then the result doesn't look like it and (161m 26s) I'm like okay I thought I understood (161m 29s) this yeah (161m 30s) but that's why it's really cool to (161m 33s) literally code you run it in a notebook (161m 35s) and it gives you a result and you're (161m 36s) like oh wow and like actual numbers (161m 39s) actual input act you know actual code (161m 40s) yeah it's not mathematical symbols Etc (161m 42s) the source of Truth is the code it's not (161m 45s) slides it's just like let's build it (161m 47s) it's beautiful you're a rare human in (161m 49s) that sense uh what advice would you give (161m 52s) to researchers uh trying to develop and (161m 54s) publish idea that have a big impact in (161m 58s) the world of AI so maybe (162m 0s) um undergrads maybe early graduate (162m 2s) students yep I mean I would say like (162m 4s) they definitely have to be a little bit (162m 6s) more strategic than I had to be as a PhD (162m 8s) student because of the way AI is (162m 10s) evolving it's going the way of physics (162m 13s) where you know in physics you used to be (162m 14s) able to do experiments on your benchtop (162m 15s) and everything was great and you could (162m 17s) make progress and now you have to work (162m 20s) in like LHC or like CERN and (162m 22s) and so AI is going in that direction as (162m 22s) well (162m 24s) um so there's certain kinds of things (162m 26s) that's just not possible to do on the (162m 29s) bench top anymore and uh (162m 32s) I think um that didn't used to be the (162m 33s) case at the time do you still think that (162m 35s) there's like (162m 38s) Gan type papers to be written where like (162m 42s) uh like very simple idea that requires (162m 43s) just one computer to illustrate a simple (162m 45s) example I mean one example that's been (162m 47s) very influential recently is diffusion (162m 48s) models diffusion models are amazing the (162m 51s) fusion models are six years old for the (162m 52s) longest time people were kind of (162m 55s) ignoring them as far as I can tell and (162m 56s) they're an amazing generative model (162m 59s) especially in uh in images and so stable (163m 0s) diffusion and so on it's all diffusion (163m 2s) based the fusion is new it was not there (163m 5s) and came from well it came from Google (163m 6s) but a researcher could have come up with (163m 8s) it in fact some of the first (163m 10s) actually no those came from Google as (163m 12s) well but a researcher could come up with (163m 14s) that in an academic Institution (163m 16s) yeah what do you find Most Fascinating (163m 19s) about diffusion models so from the (163m 21s) societal impact to the the technical (163m 22s) architecture what I like about the (163m 24s) fusion is it works so well (163m 27s) is that surprising to you the amount of (163m 29s) the variety almost the novelty of the (163m 32s) synthetic data is generating yeah so the (163m 35s) stable diffusion images are incredible (163m 38s) it's the speed of improvement in (163m 40s) generating images has been insane uh we (163m 42s) went very quickly from generating like (163m 44s) tiny digits to the tiny faces and it all (163m 45s) looked messed up and now we have stable (163m 47s) diffusion and that happened very quickly (163m 49s) there's a lot that Academia can still (163m 51s) contribute you know for example um flash (163m 54s) attention is a very efficient kernel for (163m 56s) running the attention operation inside (163m 58s) the Transformer that came from academic (163m 59s) environment it's a very clever way to (164m 3s) structure the kernel uh that that's the (164m 4s) calculation so it doesn't materialize (164m 6s) the attention Matrix (164m 7s) um and so there's I think there's still (164m 8s) like lots of things to contribute but (164m 11s) you have to be just more strategic do (164m 12s) you think neural networks could be made (164m 13s) to reason (164m 15s) uh yes (164m 17s) do you think they're already reason yes (164m 19s) what's your definition of reasoning (164m 23s) uh information processing (164m 26s) so in a way that humans think through a (164m 29s) problem and come up with novel ideas (164m 29s) it it feels like a reasoning yeah so the (164m 35s) the novelty (164m 38s) I don't want to say but out of (164m 41s) distribution ideas (164m 44s) you think it's possible yes and I think (164m 44s) we're seeing that already in the current (164m 47s) neural Nets you're able to remix the (164m 48s) training set information into true (164m 50s) generalization in some sense that (164m 53s) doesn't appear it doesn't matter (164m 55s) like you're doing something interesting (164m 57s) algorithmically you're manipulating (164m 58s) you know some symbols and you're coming (165m 0s) up with some (165m 3s) correct a unique answer in a new setting (165m 8s) what would uh illustrate to you holy (165m 10s) shit this thing is definitely thinking (165m 13s) to me thinking or reasoning is just (165m 14s) information processing and (165m 15s) generalization and I think the neural (165m 17s) Nets already do that today so being able (165m 20s) to perceive the world or perceive the (165m 24s) whatever the inputs are and to make (165m 27s) uh predictions based on that or actions (165m 27s) based on that that's that's the reason (165m 30s) yeah you're giving correct answers in (165m 31s) novel settings (165m 34s) by manipulating information you've (165m 36s) learned the correct algorithm you're not (165m 38s) doing just some kind of a lookup table (165m 39s) and there's neighbor search (165m 42s) let me ask you about AGI what what are (165m 44s) some moonshot ideas you think might make (165m 47s) significant progress towards AGI or (165m 50s) maybe in other ways what are big (165m 52s) blockers that we're missing now so (165m 53s) basically I am fairly bullish on our (165m 57s) ability to build agis uh basically (166m 0s) automated systems that we can interact (166m 1s) with and are very human-like and we can (166m 3s) interact with them in a digital realm or (166m 6s) Physical Realm currently it seems most (166m 9s) of the models that sort of do these sort (166m 11s) of magical tasks are in a text Realm (166m 14s) um I think uh as I mentioned I'm (166m 17s) suspicious that the text realm is not (166m 18s) enough to actually build full (166m 20s) understanding of the world I do actually (166m 21s) think you need to go into pixels and (166m 23s) understand the physical world and how it (166m 25s) works so I do think that we need to (166m 27s) extend these models to consume images (166m 30s) and videos and train on a lot more data (166m 31s) that is multimodal in that way (166m 33s) if you think you need to touch the world (166m 35s) to understand it also well that's the (166m 36s) big open question I would say in my mind (166m 38s) is if you also require the embodiment (166m 42s) and the ability to uh sort of interact (166m 44s) with the world run experiments and have (166m 46s) a data of that form then you need to go (166m 48s) to Optimus or something like that and so (166m 50s) I would say Optimus in some way is like (166m 52s) a hedge (166m 55s) in AGI because it seems to me that it's (166m 58s) possible that just having data from the (166m 59s) internet is not enough (167m 1s) if that is the case then Optimus may (167m 6s) lead to AGI because Optimus would I to (167m 7s) me there's nothing Beyond optimism you (167m 9s) have like this humanoid form factor that (167m 10s) can actually like do stuff in the world (167m 11s) you can have millions of them (167m 15s) interacting with humans and so on and uh (167m 16s) if that doesn't give a rise to AGI at (167m 18s) some point like not I'm not sure what (167m 19s) will (167m 21s) um so from a completeness perspective I (167m 24s) think that's the uh that's a really good (167m 26s) platform but it's a much harder platform (167m 28s) because uh you are dealing with atoms (167m 29s) and you need to actually like build (167m 31s) these things and integrate them into (167m 33s) society so I think that path takes (167m 36s) longer but it's much more certain and (167m 37s) then there's a path of the internet and (167m 39s) just like training these compression (167m 42s) models effectively uh on uh trying to (167m 43s) compress all the internet (167m 46s) and that might also give these agents as (167m 49s) well compress the internet but also (167m 51s) interact with the internet yeah so it's (167m 53s) not obvious to me (167m 56s) in fact I suspect you can reach AGI (168m 0s) without ever entering the physical world (168m 1s) and which is a little bit more (168m 5s) uh concerning because (168m 6s) it might that results in it happening (168m 8s) faster (168m 10s)\",\n",
       " \"so it just feels like we're in again (168m 12s) boiling water we won't know as it's (168m 13s) happening (168m 17s) I would like to I'm not afraid of AGI (168m 19s) I'm excited about it there's always (168m 21s) concerns but I would like to know when (168m 22s) it happens (168m 26s) yeah or and have like hints about when (168m 28s) it happens like a year from now it will (168m 30s) happen that kind of thing yeah I just (168m 31s) feel like in the digital realm it just (168m 33s) might happen yeah I think all we have (168m 35s) available to us because no one has built (168m 38s) AGI again so all we have available to us (168m 41s) is uh is there enough for cow ground on (168m 43s) the periphery I would say yes and we (168m 44s) have the progress so far which has been (168m 47s) very rapid and uh there are next steps (168m 49s) that are available and so (168m 50s) I would say uh yeah it's quite likely (168m 52s) that we'll be interacting with digital (168m 55s) entities how will you know that (168m 57s) somebody's birthday it's going to be a (168m 58s) slow I think it's going to be a slow (168m 59s) incremental transition is going to be (169m 2s) product based and focused it's going to (169m 3s) be GitHub co-pilot getting better and (169m 6s) then uh GPT is helping you right and (169m 8s) then these oracles that you can go to (169m 9s) with mathematical problems I think we're (169m 12s) on a on the verge of being able to ask (169m 13s) very complex (169m 16s) questions in chemistry physics math of (169m 18s) these oracles and have them complete (169m 19s) Solutions (169m 21s) so AGI to use primarily focus on (169m 23s) intelligence so Consciousness doesn't (169m 24s) enter (169m 26s) into uh into it (169m 29s) so in my mind Consciousness is not a (169m 30s) special thing you will you will figure (169m 32s) out and bolt-on I think it's an emerging (169m 35s) phenomenon of a large enough and complex (169m 36s) enough (169m 39s) um generative model sort of so (169m 41s) um if you have a complex and Alpha World (169m 43s) model that understands the world then it (169m 46s) also understands its predicament in the (169m 48s) world as being a language model which to (169m 49s) me is a form of Consciousness or (169m 52s) self-awareness and so in order to (169m 53s) understand the world deeply you probably (169m 55s) have to integrate yourself into the (169m 57s) world yeah and in order to interact with (169m 59s) humans and other living beings (170m 2s) Consciousness is a very useful tool I (170m 4s) think Consciousness is like a modeling (170m 5s) insight (170m 8s) modeling Insight yeah it's a you have a (170m 10s) powerful enough model of understanding (170m 10s) the world that you actually understand (170m 13s) that you are an entity in it yeah but (170m 15s) there's also this um perhaps just a (170m 17s) narrative we tell ourselves there's a it (170m 19s) feels like something to experience the (170m 21s) world the hard problem of Consciousness (170m 23s) yeah but that could be just the (170m 25s) narrative that we tell ourselves yeah I (170m 25s) don't think what yeah I think it will (170m 27s) emerge I think it's going to be (170m 29s) something uh very boring like we'll be (170m 31s) talking to these uh digital AIS they (170m 33s) will claim they're conscious they will (170m 35s) appear conscious they will do all the (170m 36s) things that you would expect of other (170m 38s) humans and uh it's going to just be a (170m 40s) stalemate I I think there would be a lot (170m 43s) of actual fascinating ethical questions (170m 46s) like Supreme Court level questions (170m 50s) of whether you're allowed to turn off a (170m 52s) conscious AI if you're allowed to build (170m 54s) the conscious AI (170m 57s) maybe there would have to be the same (171m 0s) kind of debates that you have around (171m 2s) um sorry to bring up a political topic (171m 6s) but you know abortion which is the (171m 8s) deeper question with abortion (171m 11s) is what is life and the Deep question (171m 15s) with AI is also what is life and what is (171m 17s) conscious and I think that'll be very (171m 19s) fascinating (171m 22s) to bring up it might become illegal to (171m 25s) build systems that are capable that like (171m 28s) of such a level of intelligence that (171m 30s) Consciousness would emerge and therefore (171m 31s) the capacity to suffer would emerge and (171m 34s) some A system that says no please don't (171m 36s) kill me well that's what the Lambda (171m 40s) compute the Lambda chatbot already told (171m 41s) um this Google engineer right like it it (171m 43s) was talking about not wanting to die or (171m 45s) so on so that might become illegal to do (171m 48s) that right (171m 50s) I because otherwise you might have a lot (171m 52s) of a lot of creatures that don't want to (171m 55s) die and they will uh you can just spawn (171m 58s) Infinity of them on a cluster (172m 0s) and then that might lead to like (172m 2s) horrible consequences because then there (172m 3s) might be a lot of people that secretly (172m 5s) love murder and they'll start practicing (172m 7s) murder on those systems I mean there's (172m 10s) just I to me all of this stuff just (172m 13s) brings a beautiful mirror to The Human (172m 14s) Condition and human nature we'll get to (172m 17s) explore it and that's what like the best (172m 19s) of uh the Supreme Court of all the (172m 21s) different debates we have about ideas of (172m 23s) what it means to be human we get to ask (172m 25s) those deep questions that we've been (172m 27s) asking throughout human history there's (172m 29s) always been the other in human history (172m 31s) uh we're the good guys and that's the (172m 34s) bad guys and we're going to uh you know (172m 35s) throughout human history let's murder (172m 38s) the bad guys and the same will probably (172m 40s) happen with robots it'll be the other at (172m 42s) first and then we'll get to ask (172m 43s) questions of what does it mean to be (172m 45s) alive what does it mean to be conscious (172m 47s) yeah and I think there's some Canary in (172m 48s) the coal mines even with what we have (172m 49s) today (172m 51s) um and uh you know for example these (172m 52s) there's these like waifus that you like (172m 54s) work with and some people are trying to (172m 56s) like this company is going to shut down (172m 58s) but this person really like yeah love (173m 0s) their waifu and like is trying to like (173m 1s) Port it somewhere else and like it's not (173m 3s) possible and like I think like (173m 6s) definitely uh people will have feelings (173m 9s) towards uh towards these um systems (173m 11s) because in some sense they are like a (173m 14s) mirror of humanity because they are like (173m 16s) sort of like a big average of humanity (173m 18s) yeah in a way that it's trained but we (173m 20s) can that average we can actually watch (173m 22s) it's nice to be able to interact with (173m 25s) the big average of humanity yeah and do (173m 27s) like a search query on it yeah yeah it's (173m 30s) very fascinating and uh we can also of (173m 32s) course also like shape it it's not just (173m 34s) a pure average we can mess with the (173m 34s) training data we can mess with the (173m 36s) objective we can fine tune them in (173m 38s) various ways so we have some (173m 41s) um you know impact on what those systems (173m 45s) look like if you want to achieve AGI (173m 46s) um and you could have a conversation (173m 49s) with her and ask her uh talk about (173m 51s) anything maybe ask her a question what (173m 54s) kind of stuff would you would you ask I (173m 55s) would have some practical questions in (173m 58s) my mind like uh do I or my loved ones (174m 0s) really have to die uh what can we do (174m 1s) about that (174m 4s) do you think it will answer clearly or (174m 7s) would it answer poetically (174m 8s) I would expect it to give Solutions I (174m 10s) would expect it to be like well I've (174m 12s) read all of these textbooks and I know (174m 12s) all these things that you've produced (174m 14s) and it seems to me like here are the (174m 15s) experiments that I think it would be (174m 17s) useful to run next and hear some Gene (174m 18s) therapies that I think would be helpful (174m 21s) and uh here are the kinds of experiments (174m 23s) that you should run okay let's go over (174m 24s) the Start experiment okay (174m 29s) imagine that mortality is actually uh (174m 33s) like a prerequisite for happiness so if (174m 34s) we become immortal we'll actually become (174m 38s) deeply unhappy and the model is able to (174m 39s) know that so what is this supposed to (174m 42s) tell you stupid human about it yes you (174m 43s) can become a mortal but you will become (174m 46s) deeply unhappy (174m 49s) if if the model is if the AGI system (174m 51s) is trying to empathize with you human (174m 53s) what is this supposed to tell you that (174m 56s) yes you don't have to die but you're (174m 58s) really not going to like it because that (174m 59s) is it going to be deeply honest like (175m 2s) there's a Interstellar what is it the AI (175m 7s) says like humans want 90 honesty (175m 9s) so like you have to pick how honest I (175m 11s) want to answer these practical questions (175m 14s) yeah I love Yeah Interstellar by the way (175m 15s) I think it's like such a sidekick to the (175m 17s) entire story but (175m 19s) at the same time it's like really (175m 20s) interesting it's kind of limited in (175m 23s) certain ways right yeah it's limited and (175m 24s) I think that's totally fine by the way I (175m 26s) don't think uh I think it's (175m 28s) find impossible to have a limited and (175m 32s) imperfect agis (175m 34s) is that the feature almost as an example (175m 37s) like it has a fixed amount of compute on (175m 38s) its physical body and it might just be (175m 41s) that even though you can have a super (175m 43s) amazing Mega brain super intelligent AI (175m 45s) you also can have like you know less (175m 48s) intelligent AIS that you can deploy in a (175m 49s) power efficient way and then they're not (175m 51s) perfect they might make mistakes no I (175m 54s) meant more like say you had infinite (175m 55s) compute and it's still good to make (175m 57s) mistakes sometimes (175m 59s) like in order to integrate yourself like (176m 0s) um (176m 2s) what is it going back to Goodwill (176m 5s) Hunting uh Robin Williams character (176m 6s) says like the human imperfections that's (176m 10s) the good stuff right isn't it isn't that (176m 12s) this like we don't want perfect we want (176m 16s) flaws in part to form connections with (176m 18s) each other because it feels like (176m 18s) something you can attach your feelings (176m 20s) to (176m 23s) the the flaws in that same way you want (176m 26s) an AI That's flawed I don't know I feel (176m 28s) like perfectionist but then you're (176m 31s) saying okay yeah but that's not AGI but (176m 33s) see AGI would need to be intelligent (176m 35s) enough to give answers to humans that (176m 36s) humans don't understand and I think (176m 38s) perfect isn't something humans can't (176m 41s) understand because even science doesn't (176m 43s) give perfect answers there's always gabs (176m 47s) and Mysteries and I don't know I I don't (176m 48s) know if humans want perfect (176m 51s) yeah I could imagine just uh having a (176m 53s) conversation with this kind of Oracle (176m 56s) entity as you'd imagine them and uh yeah (176m 57s) maybe it can tell you about (176m 59s) you know based on my analysis of Human (177m 2s) Condition uh you might not want this and (177m 4s) here are some of the things that might (177m 7s) but every every dumb human will say yeah (177m 11s) yeah trust me I can give me the truth I (177m 13s) can handle it but that's the beauty a (177m 16s) lot of people can choose uh so but then (177m 19s) the old marshmallow test with the kids (177m 22s) and so on I feel like too many people (177m 24s) uh like it can't handle the truth (177m 27s) probably including myself like the Deep (177m 28s) truth of The Human Condition I don't I (177m 30s) don't know if I can handle it like what (177m 33s) if there's some dark stuff what if we (177m 35s) are an alien science experiment and it (177m 38s) realizes that what if it had I mean (177m 40s) I mean this is the Matrix you know the (177m 41s) middle over again (177m 44s) I don't know I would what would I talk (177m 48s) about I don't even yeah I (177m 50s) uh probably I will go with the save for (177m 53s) scientific questions at first that have (177m 55s) nothing to do with my own personal life (177m 58s) yeah immortality just like about physics (178m 1s) and so on yeah uh to build up like let's (178m 2s) see where it's at or maybe see if it has (178m 4s) a sense of humor that's another question (178m 7s) would it be able to uh presumably in (178m 9s) order to if it understands humans deeply (178m 12s) would able to generate (178m 15s) uh yep to generate humor yeah I think (178m 17s) that's actually a wonderful Benchmark (178m 19s) almost like is it able I think that's a (178m 21s) really good point basically to make you (178m 22s) laugh yeah if it's able to be like a (178m 25s) very effective stand-up comedian that is (178m 25s) doing something very interesting (178m 27s) computationally I think being funny is (178m 30s) extremely hard yeah (178m 31s) because (178m 34s) it's hard in a way like a touring test (178m 36s) the original intent of the touring test (178m 39s) is hard because you have to convince (178m 42s) humans and there's nothing that's why (178m 44s) that's why when comedians talk about (178m 47s) this like there's this is deeply honest (178m 49s) because if people can't help but laugh (178m 50s) and if they don't laugh that means (178m 52s) you're not funny they laugh that's funny (178m 54s) and you're showing you need a lot of (178m 55s) knowledge to create to create humor (178m 57s) about like the occupational Human (178m 58s) Condition and so on and then you need to (179m 0s) be clever with it (179m 2s) uh you mentioned a few movies you (179m 3s) tweeted movies that I've seen five plus (179m 7s) times but I'm ready and willing to keep (179m 9s) watching Interstellar Gladiator contact (179m 11s) Goodwill Hunting The Matrix Lord of the (179m 15s) Rings all three Avatar Fifth Element so (179m 17s) on goes on Terminator two Mean Girls I'm (179m 19s) not gonna ask about that (179m 23s) mean girls is great (179m 24s) um what are some of the jump onto your (179m 27s) memory that you love (179m 30s) and why like you mentioned the Matrix (179m 32s) as a computer person why do you love The (179m 33s) Matrix (179m 35s) there's so many properties that make it (179m 36s) like beautiful and interesting so (179m 37s) there's all these philosophical (179m 40s) questions but then there's also agis and (179m 43s) there's simulation and it's cool and (179m 44s) there's you know the black uh you know (179m 47s) uh the look of it the feel of it the (179m 48s) look of it the feel of it the action the (179m 50s) bullet time it was just like innovating (179m 52s) in so many ways (179m 56s) and then uh Good Good Will Hunting why (179m 58s) do you like that one yeah I just I (180m 1s) really like this uh torture genius sort (180m 3s) of character who's like grappling with (180m 5s) whether or not he has like any (180m 6s) responsibility or like what to do with (180m 8s) this gift that he was given or like how (180m 11s) to think about the whole thing and uh (180m 13s) there's also a dance between the genius (180m 16s) and the the personal like what it means (180m 17s) to love another human being and there's (180m 19s) a lot of themes there it's just a (180m 20s) beautiful movie and then the fatherly (180m 22s) figure The Mentor in the in the (180m 25s) psychiatrist and the it like really like (180m 26s) uh (180m 27s) it messes with you you know there's some (180m 28s) movies that's just like really mess with (180m 31s) you uh on a deep level do you relate to (180m 34s) that movie at all no it's not your fault (180m 36s) doctor as I said Lord of the Rings (180m 40s) that's self-explanatory Terminator 2 (180m 41s) which is interesting (180m 43s) you we watch that a lot is that better (180m 45s) than Terminator one (180m 47s) you like you like Arnold I do like (180m 50s) Terminator one as well uh I like (180m 51s) Terminator 2 a little bit more but in (180m 53s) terms of like its surface properties (180m 55s) [Laughter] (180m 56s) do you think Skynet is at all a (180m 59s) possibility oh yes (181m 1s) well like the actual sort of uh (181m 3s) autonomous uh weapon system kind of (181m 8s) thing do you worry about that uh stuff (181m 8s) I 100 worry about it and so the I mean (181m 13s) the uh you know some of these uh fears (181m 15s) of AGS and how this will plan out I mean (181m 15s) these will be like very powerful (181m 18s) entities probably at some point and so (181m 19s) um for a long time they're going to be (181m 22s) tools in the hands of humans uh you know (181m 23s) people talk about like alignment of agis (181m 25s) and how to make the problem is like even (181m 28s) humans are not aligned uh so (181m 30s) uh how this will be used and what this (181m 32s) is going to look like is um yeah it's (181m 34s) troubling so (181m 36s) do you think it'll happen so slowly (181m 38s) enough that we'll be able to (181m 40s) as a human civilization think through (181m 42s) the problems yes that's my hope is that (181m 44s) it happens slowly enough and in an open (181m 45s) enough way where a lot of people can see (181m 48s) and participate in it just figure out (181m 50s) how to deal with this transition I think (181m 51s) which is going to be interesting I draw (181m 54s) a lot of inspiration from nuclear (181m 56s) weapons because I sure thought it would (181m 58s) be it would be fucked once they develop (182m 0s) nuclear weapons but like it's almost (182m 2s) like (182m 5s) uh when the when the systems are not so (182m 6s) dangerous they destroy human (182m 9s) civilization we deploy them and learn (182m 11s) the lessons and then we quickly if it's (182m 13s) too dangerous we're quickly quicker we (182m 16s) might still deploy it uh but you very (182m 17s) quickly learn not to use them and so (182m 19s) there'll be like this balance that you (182m 21s) humans are very clever as a species it's (182m 24s) interesting we exploit the resources as (182m 26s) much as we can but we don't we avoid (182m 28s) destroying ourselves it seems like (182m 30s) well I don't know about that actually I (182m 32s) hope it continues (182m 33s) um (182m 34s) I mean I'm definitely like concerned (182m 36s) about nuclear weapons and so on not just (182m 39s) as a result of the recent conflict even (182m 41s) before that uh that's probably like my (182m 43s) number one concern for society so if (182m 46s) Humanity uh destroys itself (182m 49s) or destroys you know 90 of people that (182m 53s) would be because of nukes I think so (182m 54s) um and it's not even about full (182m 57s) destruction to me it's bad enough if we (182m 58s) reset society that would be like (183m 0s) terrible it would be really bad and I (183m 2s) can't believe we're like so close to it (183m 5s) yeah it's like so crazy to me it feels (183m 6s) like we might be a few tweets away from (183m 9s) something like that yep basically it's (183m 12s) extremely unnerving but and has been for (183m 14s) me for a long time (183m 17s) it seems unstable that world leaders (183m 20s) just having a bad mood (183m 22s) can like um (183m 24s) take one step towards a bad Direction (183m 28s) and it escalates yeah and because of a (183m 30s) collection of bad moods it can escalate (183m 32s) without being able to (183m 34s) um stop (183m 36s) yeah it's just it's a huge amount of uh (183m 38s) Power and then also with the (183m 39s) proliferation and basically I don't I (183m 41s) don't actually really see I don't (183m 42s) actually know what the good outcomes are (183m 43s) here (183m 45s) uh so I'm definitely worried about that (183m 48s) a lot and then AGI is not currently (183m 49s) there but I think at some point we'll (183m 52s) more and more become uh something like (183m 55s) it the danger with AGI even is that I (183m 56s) think it's even less likely worse in a (183m 57s) sense that (184m 1s) uh there are good outcomes of AGI and (184m 2s) then the bad outcomes are like an (184m 4s) absolute way like a tiny one way and so (184m 7s) I think um capitalism and humanity and (184m 9s) so on will drive for the positive (184m 12s) uh ways of using that technology but (184m 13s) then if bad outcomes are just like a (184m 16s) tiny like flipping minus sign away uh (184m 17s)\",\n",
       " \"that's a really bad position to be in a (184m 19s) tiny perturbation of the system results (184m 22s) in the destruction of the human species (184m 24s) it's a weird line to walk yeah I think (184m 26s) in general what's really weird about (184m 27s) like the Dynamics of humanity and this (184m 29s) explosion was talked about is just like (184m 31s) the insane coupling afforded by (184m 33s) technology yeah and uh just the (184m 35s) instability of the whole dynamical (184m 37s) system I think it's just it doesn't look (184m 38s) good honestly (184m 40s) yes that explosion could be destructive (184m 42s) and constructive and the probabilities (184m 45s) are non-zero in both both senses I'm (184m 46s) going to have to I do feel like I have (184m 48s) to try to be optimistic and so on and (184m 50s) yes I think even in this case I still am (184m 51s) predominantly optimistic but there's (184m 52s) definitely (184m 55s) me too uh do you think we'll become a (184m 58s) multiplayer species (184m 59s) probably yes but I don't know if it's (185m 2s) dominant feature of uh future Humanity (185m 5s) uh there might be some people on some (185m 7s) planets and so on but I'm not sure if (185m 8s) it's like (185m 10s) yeah if it's like a major player in our (185m 13s) culture and so on we still have to solve (185m 15s) the drivers of self-destruction here on (185m 17s) Earth so just having a backup on Mars is (185m 20s) not going to solve the problem so by the (185m 21s) way I love the backup on Mars I think (185m 22s) that's amazing you should absolutely do (185m 26s) that yes and I'm so thankful uh and (185m 29s) would you go to Mars uh personally no I (185m 32s) do like Earth quite a lot okay uh I'll (185m 33s) go to Mars I'll go for you unless I'll (185m 35s) tweet at you from there maybe eventually (185m 37s) I would once it's uh safe enough but I (185m 39s) don't actually know if it's on my (185m 41s) lifetime scale unless I can extend it by (185m 42s) a lot (185m 43s) I do think that for example a lot of (185m 45s) people might disappear into (185m 47s) um virtual realities and stuff like that (185m 48s) and I think that could be the major (185m 49s) thrust of (185m 50s) um sort of the cultural development of (185m 54s) humanity if it survives uh so it might (185m 55s) not be it's just really hard to work in (185m 58s) Physical Realm and go out there and I (185m 59s) think ultimately all your experiences (186m 2s) are in your brain yeah and so it's much (186m 5s) easier to disappear into digital Realm (186m 7s) and I think people will find them more (186m 9s) compelling easier safer (186m 11s) more interesting so you're a little bit (186m 12s) captivated by Virtual Reality by the (186m 14s) possible worlds whether it's the (186m 16s) metaverse or some other manifestation of (186m 17s) that yeah (186m 20s) yeah it's really interesting it's uh (186m 24s) I'm I'm interested just just talking a (186m 26s) lot to Carmack where's the (186m 28s) where's the thing that's currently (186m 30s) preventing that yeah I mean to be clear (186m 31s) I think what's interesting about the (186m 32s) future is (186m 35s) um it's not that (186m 36s) I kind of feel like (186m 37s) the variance in The Human Condition (186m 39s) grows that's the primary thing that's (186m 42s) changing it's not as much the mean of (186m 42s) the distribution it's like the variance (186m 44s) of it so there will probably be people (186m 46s) on Mars and there will be people in VR (186m 46s) and they're all people here on Earth (186m 48s) it's just like there will be so many (186m 50s) more ways of being (186m 52s) and so I kind of feel like I see it as (186m 52s) like a spreading out of a human (186m 55s) experience there's something about the (186m 56s) internet that allows you to discover (186m 58s) those little groups and you you (187m 0s) gravitate each other something about (187m 1s) your biology likes that kind of world (187m 3s) and that you find each other yeah and (187m 5s) we'll have transhumanists and then we'll (187m 5s) have the Amish and they're gonna (187m 7s) everything is just gonna coexist you (187m 8s) know the cool thing about it because (187m 9s) I've interacted with a bunch of Internet (187m 11s) communities is (187m 15s) um they don't know about each other like (187m 17s) you can have a very happy existence just (187m 19s) like having a very close-knit community (187m 21s) and not knowing about each other I mean (187m 22s) even even since this just having (187m 25s) traveled to Ukraine there's they they (187m 28s) don't know so many things about America (187m 30s) you you like when you travel across the (187m 32s) world I think you experience this too (187m 34s) there are certain cultures they're like (187m 36s) they have their own thing going on they (187m 38s) don't and so you can see that happening (187m 40s) more and more and more and more in the (187m 42s) future we have little communities yeah (187m 43s) yeah I think so that seems to be the (187m 45s) that seems to be how it's going right (187m 47s) now and I don't see that Trend like (187m 49s) really reversing I think people are (187m 50s) diverse and they're able to choose their (187m 52s) own like path and existence and I sort (187m 55s) of like celebrate that (187m 57s) um and so will you spend so much time in (187m 59s) the meters in the virtual reality or (188m 1s) which Community are you are you the (188m 5s) physicalist uh the the the physical (188m 8s) reality enjoyer or uh do you see drawing (188m 11s) a lot of uh pleasure and fulfillment in (188m 13s) the digital world (188m 14s) yeah I think well currently the virtual (188m 17s) reality is not that compelling I do (188m 19s) think it can improve a lot but I don't (188m 21s) really know to what extent maybe you (188m 22s) know there's actually like even more (188m 24s) exotic things you can think about with (188m 28s) like neural links or stuff like that so (188m 29s) um currently I kind of see myself as (188m 31s) mostly a team human person I love nature (188m 35s) yeah I love Harmony I love people I love (188m 38s) Humanity I love emotions of humanity (188m 41s) um and I I just want to be like in this (188m 42s) like solar Punk little Utopia that's my (188m 45s) happy place yeah my happy place is like (188m 47s) uh people I love thinking about cool (188m 49s) problems surrounded by a lush beautiful (188m 51s) Dynamic nature yeah yeah and secretly (188m 53s) high tech in places that count places (188m 57s) like they use technology to empower that (189m 0s) love for other humans and nature yeah I (189m 1s) think a technology used like very (189m 3s) sparingly uh I don't love when it sort (189m 5s) of gets in the way of humanity in many (189m 8s) ways uh I like just people being humans (189m 11s) in a way we sort of like slightly (189m 12s) evolved and prefer I think just by (189m 14s) default people kept asking me because (189m 15s) they they know you love reading are (189m 17s) there particular books (189m 20s) that you enjoyed that had an impact on (189m 21s) you (189m 24s) for silly or for profound reasons that (189m 26s) you would recommend (189m 28s) you mentioned the vital question (189m 30s) many of course I think in biology as an (189m 32s) example the vital question is a good one (189m 35s) anything by McLean really uh life (189m 36s) ascending I would say is like a bit more (189m 39s) potentially uh representative as like a (189m 41s) summary (189m 43s) of a lot of the things he's been talking (189m 45s) about I was very impacted by the selfish (189m 46s) Gene I thought that was a really good (189m 48s) book that helped me understand altruism (189m 50s) as an example and where it comes from (189m 52s) and just realizing that you know the (189m 53s) selection is in the level of genes was a (189m 55s) huge insight for me at the time and it (189m 55s) sort of like cleared up a lot of things (189m 57s) for me what do you think about (190m 0s) the the idea that ideas of the organisms (190m 2s) the means yes love it 100 (190m 5s) [Laughter] (190m 7s) are you able to walk around with that (190m 10s) notion for a while that that there is an (190m 12s) evolutionary kind of process with ideas (190m 13s) as well there absolutely is there's (190m 15s) memes just like genes and they compete (190m 18s) and they live in our brains it's (190m 20s) beautiful are we silly humans thinking (190m 22s) that we're the organisms is it possible (190m 24s) that the primary (190m 26s) organisms are the ideas (190m 28s) yeah I would say like the the ideas kind (190m 30s) of live in the software of like our (190m 32s) civilization in the in the minds and so (190m 35s) on we think as humans that the hardware (190m 39s) is the fundamental thing I human is a (190m 40s) hardware entity yeah but it could be the (190m 44s) software right yeah (190m 45s) yeah I would say like there needs to be (190m 47s) some grounding at some point to like a (190m 49s) physical reality yeah but if we clone an (190m 51s) Andre (190m 52s) the software is the thing (190m 56s) like is this thing that makes that thing (190m 58s) special right yeah I guess I you're (191m 0s) right but then cloning might be (191m 1s) exceptionally difficult like there might (191m 3s) be a deep integration between the (191m 5s) software and the hardware in ways we (191m 6s) don't quite understand well from the (191m 7s) evolution point of view like what makes (191m 9s) me special is more like the the gang of (191m 12s) genes that are writing in my chromosomes (191m 13s) I suppose right like they're the they're (191m 15s) the replicating unit I suppose and no (191m 17s) but that's just for you the thing that (191m 21s) makes you special sure wow (191m 25s) the reality is what makes you special is (191m 27s) your ability to survive (191m 30s) based on the software that runs on the (191m 33s) hardware that was built by the genes (191m 35s) um so the software is the thing that (191m 37s) makes you survive not the hardware (191m 39s) all right yeah it's just like a second (191m 41s) layer it's a new second layer that (191m 42s) hasn't been there before the brain they (191m 44s) both they both coexist but there's also (191m 47s) layers of the software I mean it's it's (191m 49s) not it's a it's a abstraction that's uh (191m 52s) on top of abstractions but okay so (191m 55s) selfish Gene um a neckline I would say (191m 57s) sometimes books are like not sufficient (192m 1s) I like to reach for textbooks sometimes (192m 3s) um I kind of feel like books are for too (192m 4s) much of a general consumption sometime (192m 6s) and they just kind of like uh they're (192m 7s) too high up in the level of abstraction (192m 10s) and it's not good enough yeah so I like (192m 12s) textbooks I like the cell I think the (192m 13s) cell was pretty cool (192m 16s) uh that's why also I like the writing of (192m 18s) uh McLean is because he's pretty willing (192m 23s) to step one level down and he doesn't uh (192m 24s) yeah he's sort of he's willing to go (192m 25s) there (192m 26s) but he's also willing to sort of be (192m 28s) throughout the stack so he'll go down to (192m 30s) a lot of detail but then he will come (192m 32s) back up and I think he has a yeah (192m 34s) basically I really appreciate that (192m 35s) that's why I love college early college (192m 38s) even high school but just textbooks on (192m 40s) the basics yeah of Computer Science and (192m 43s) Mathematics of of biology of chemistry (192m 47s) yes those are they condense down like uh (192m 50s) uh it's sufficiently General that you (192m 50s) can understand the both the philosophy (192m 53s) and the details but also like you get (192m 55s) homework problems and you you get to (192m 57s) play with it as much as you would if you (192m 59s) weren't yeah programming stuff yeah and (193m 0s) then I'm also suspicious of textbooks (193m 3s) honestly because as an example in deep (193m 4s) learning uh there's no like amazing (193m 6s) textbooks and I feel this changing very (193m 8s) quickly I imagine the same is true and (193m 10s) say uh synthetic biology and so on these (193m 12s) books like this cell are kind of (193m 13s) outdated they're still high level like (193m 16s) what is the actual real source of truth (193m 17s) it's people in wet Labs working with (193m 20s) cells yeah you know sequencing genomes (193m 22s) and (193m 24s) yeah actually working with working with (193m 25s) it and uh I don't have that much (193m 27s) exposure to that or what that looks like (193m 29s) so I sold them fully I'm reading through (193m 30s) the cell and it's kind of interesting (193m 31s) and I'm learning but it's still not (193m 32s) sufficient I would say in terms of (193m 35s) understanding well it's a clean (193m 36s) summarization of the mainstream (193m 37s) narrative (193m 40s) yeah but you have to learn that before (193m 42s) you break out yeah towards The Cutting (193m 44s) Edge yeah what is the actual process of (193m 46s) working with these cells and growing (193m 48s) them and incubating them and you know (193m 49s) it's kind of like a massive cooking (193m 51s) recipe so making sure your self slows (193m 51s) and proliferate and then you're (193m 53s) sequencing them running experiments and (193m 55s) uh just how that works I think is kind (193m 57s) of like the source of truth of at the (193m 59s) end of the day what's really useful in (194m 1s) terms of creating therapies and so on (194m 3s) yeah I wonder in the future AI textbooks (194m 5s) will be because you know there's a (194m 7s) artificial intelligence a modern (194m 8s) approach I actually haven't read if it's (194m 11s) come out the recent version the recent (194m 13s) there's been a recent Edition I also saw (194m 15s) there's a science a deep learning book (194m 16s) I'm waiting for textbooks that worth (194m 18s) recommending worth reading it's It's (194m 21s) tricky because it's like papers (194m 25s) and code code honestly papers are quite (194m 27s) good I especially like the appendix (194m 28s) appendix of any paper as well it's like (194m 32s) it's like the most detail it can have (194m 35s) it doesn't have to be cohesive to (194m 35s) connected to anything else you just (194m 37s) describe me a very specific way you (194m 39s) solved a particular thing yeah many (194m 40s) times papers can be actually quite (194m 42s) readable not always but sometimes the (194m 43s) introduction in the abstract is readable (194m 45s) even for someone outside of the field uh (194m 47s) not this is not always true and (194m 48s) sometimes I think unfortunately (194m 51s) scientists use complex terms even when (194m 53s) it's not necessary I think that's (194m 54s) harmful I think there there's no reason (194m 57s) for that and papers sometimes are longer (194m 59s) than they need to be in this in the (194m 59s) parts that (195m 2s) don't matter yeah appendix would be long (195m 4s) but then the paper itself you know look (195m 6s) at Einstein make it simple (195m 8s) yeah but certainly I've come across (195m 8s) papers I would say in say like synthetic (195m 11s) biology or something that I thought were (195m 11s) quite readable for the abstract and the (195m 13s) introduction and then you're reading the (195m 14s) rest of it and you don't fully (195m 16s) understand but you kind of are getting a (195m 19s) gist and I think it's cool (195m 22s) what uh advice you give advice to folks (195m 24s) interested in machine learning and (195m 27s) research but in General Life advice to a (195m 28s) young person High School (195m 31s) um Early College about how to have a (195m 32s) career they can be proud of or a life (195m 35s) they can be proud of (195m 36s) yeah I think I'm very hesitant to give (195m 38s) general advice I think it's really hard (195m 39s) I've mentioned like some of the stuff (195m 40s) I've mentioned is fairly General I think (195m 43s) like focus on just the amount of work (195m 44s) you're spending on like a thing (195m 47s) uh compare yourself only to yourself not (195m 48s) to others that's good I think those are (195m 51s) fairly General how do you pick the thing (195m 53s) uh you just have like a deep interest in (195m 55s) something uh or like try to like find (195m 57s) the art Max over like the things that (195m 59s) you're interested in ARG Max at that (196m 1s) moment and stick with it how do you not (196m 3s) get distracted and switch to another (196m 7s) thing uh you can if you like (196m 10s) um well if you do an ARG Max repeatedly (196m 11s) every week it doesn't converge it (196m 13s) doesn't it's a problem yeah you can like (196m 15s) low pass filter yourself uh in terms of (196m 16s) like what has consistently been true for (196m 18s) you (196m 20s) um but yeah I definitely see how it can (196m 23s) be hard but I would say like you're (196m 23s) going to work the hardest on the thing (196m 26s) that you care about the most also a low (196m 27s) pass filter yourself and really (196m 29s) introspect in your past were the things (196m 31s) that gave you energy and what are the (196m 32s) things that took energy away from you (196m 35s) concrete examples and usually uh from (196m 36s) those concrete examples sometimes (196m 39s) patterns can merge I like I like it when (196m 40s) things look like this when I'm these (196m 41s) positions so that's not necessarily the (196m 44s) field but the kind of stuff you're doing (196m 45s) in a particular field so for you it (196m 48s) seems like you were energized by (196m 49s) implementing stuff building actual (196m 52s) things yeah being low level learning and (196m 54s) then also uh communicating so that (196m 55s) others can go through the same (196m 58s) realizations and shortening that Gap (197m 0s) um because I usually have to do way too (197m 1s) much work to understand the thing and (197m 2s) then I'm like okay this is actually like (197m 4s) okay I think I get it and like why was (197m 7s) it so much work it should have been much (197m 9s) less work and that gives me a lot of (197m 11s) frustration and that's why I sometimes (197m 13s) go teach so aside from the teaching (197m 16s) you're doing now uh putting out videos (197m 19s) aside from a potential uh Godfather part (197m 20s) two (197m 24s) uh with the AGI at Tesla and Beyond uh (197m 26s) what does the future for Android kapati (197m 27s) hold have you figured that out yet or no (197m 30s) I mean uh as you see through the fog of (197m 34s) war that is all of our future (197m 36s) um do you do you start seeing (197m 38s) silhouettes of the what that possible (197m 40s) future could look like (197m 41s) the consistent thing I've been always (197m 43s) interested in for me at least is is AI (197m 46s) and um (197m 47s) uh that's probably where I'm spending my (197m 49s) rest of my life on because I just care (197m 51s) about a lot and I actually care about (197m 52s) like many other problems as well like (197m 54s) say aging which I basically view as (197m 57s) disease and uh (197m 58s) um I care about that as well but I don't (198m 1s) think it's a good idea to go after it (198m 3s) specifically I don't actually think that (198m 5s) humans will be able to come up with the (198m 6s) answer I think the correct thing to do (198m 8s) is to ignore those problems and you (198m 10s) solve Ai and then use that to solve (198m 12s) everything else and I think there's a (198m 12s) chance that this will work I think it's (198m 15s) a very high chance and uh that's kind of (198m 18s) like the the way I'm betting at least so (198m 20s) when you think about AI are you (198m 22s) interested in all kinds of applications (198m 25s) all kinds of domains and any domain you (198m 27s) focus on will allow you to get insights (198m 30s) to the big problem of AGI yeah for me (198m 31s) it's the ultimate mental problem I don't (198m 33s) want to work on any one specific problem (198m 34s) there's too many problems so how can you (198m 36s) work on all problems simultaneously you (198m 38s) solve The Meta problem which to me is (198m 39s) just intelligence and how do you (198m 43s) automate it is there cool small projects (198m 46s) like archive sanity and and so on that (198m 49s) you're thinking about the the the the (198m 52s) world the ml world can anticipate (198m 53s) there's some always like some fun side (198m 55s) projects yeah um archive sanity is one (198m 57s) basically like there's way too many (199m 0s) archive papers how can I organize it and (199m 2s) recommend papers and so on uh I (199m 4s) transcribed all of your yeah podcasts (199m 5s) what did you learn from that experience (199m 9s) uh from transcribing the process of like (199m 11s)\",\n",
       " \"you like consuming audiobooks and and (199m 13s) podcasts and so on and here's the (199m 15s) process that achieves (199m 17s) um closer to human level performance and (199m 20s) annotation yeah well I definitely was (199m 21s) like surprised that uh transcription (199m 24s) with opening eyes whisper was working so (199m 26s) well compared to what I'm familiar with (199m 28s) from Siri and like a few other systems I (199m 31s) guess it works so well and (199m 32s) uh that's what gave me some energy to (199m 34s) like try it out and I thought it could (199m 36s) be fun to random podcasts it's kind of (199m 40s) not obvious to me why whisper is so much (199m 41s) better compared to anything else because (199m 42s) I feel like there should be a lot of (199m 43s) incentive for a lot of companies to (199m 44s) produce transcription systems and that (199m 46s) they've done so over a long time whisper (199m 48s) is not a super exotic model it's a (199m 51s) Transformer it takes smell spectrograms (199m 53s) and you know just outputs tokens of text (199m 55s) it's not crazy uh the model and (199m 57s) everything has been around for a long (199m 58s) time (200m 0s) I'm not actually 100 sure why yeah it's (200m 2s) not obvious to me either it makes me (200m 3s) feel like I'm missing something I'm (200m 6s) missing something yeah because there's a (200m 9s) huge even at Google and so on YouTube uh (200m 10s) transcription yeah (200m 12s) um yeah it's unclear but some of it is (200m 14s) also integrating into a bigger system (200m 18s) yeah that so the user interface how it's (200m 19s) deployed and all that kind of stuff (200m 21s) maybe running it as an independent thing (200m 23s) is eat much easier like an order of (200m 25s) magnitude easier than deploying to a (200m 27s) large integrated system like YouTube (200m 30s) transcription or (200m 32s) um anything like meetings like Zoom has (200m 34s) trans transcription that's kind of (200m 37s) crappy but creating uh interface where (200m 38s) it detects the different individual (200m 42s) speakers it's able to (200m 42s) um (200m 46s) display it in compelling ways Run in (200m 46s) real time all that kind of stuff maybe (200m 50s) that's difficult but that's the only (200m 52s) explanation I have because like um (200m 55s) I'm currently paying uh quite a bit for (200m 57s) human uh transcription human caption (201m 0s) right annotation and like it seems like (201m 3s) uh there's a huge incentive to automate (201m 4s) that yeah it's very confusing and I (201m 5s) think I mean I don't know if you looked (201m 7s) at some of the whisper transcripts but (201m 9s) they're quite good they're good and (201m 11s) especially in tricky cases yeah I've (201m 13s) seen (201m 15s) uh Whispers performance on like super (201m 17s) tricky cases and it does incredibly well (201m 20s) so I don't know a podcast is pretty (201m 23s) simple it's like high quality audio and (201m 25s) you're speaking usually pretty clearly (201m 28s) and so I don't know it uh I don't know (201m 32s) what open ai's plans are yeah either but (201m 33s) yeah there's always like fun fun (201m 35s) projects basically and stable diffusion (201m 36s) also is opening up a huge amount of (201m 37s) experimentation I would say in the (201m 39s) visual realm and generate generating (201m 43s) images and videos and movies videos now (201m 44s) and so that's going to be pretty crazy (201m 46s) uh that's going to that's going to (201m 49s) almost certainly work and it's going to (201m 50s) be really interesting when the cost of (201m 52s) content creation is going to fall to (201m 54s) zero you used to need a painter for a (201m 55s) few months to paint a thing and now it's (201m 57s) going to be speak to your phone to get (202m 0s) your video so if Hollywood will start (202m 3s) using that to generate scene means (202m 6s) which completely opens up yeah so you (202m 8s) can make a like a movie like Avatar (202m 11s) eventually for under a million dollars (202m 14s) much less maybe just by talking to your (202m 14s) phone I mean I know it sounds kind of (202m 16s) crazy (202m 18s) and then there'd be some voting (202m 19s) mechanism like how do you have a like (202m 21s) would there be a show on Netflix that's (202m 24s) generated completely uh automatedly (202m 27s) potentially yeah and what does it look (202m 29s) like also when you can just generate It (202m 32s) On Demand and it's uh and there's (202m 34s) Infinity of it yeah (202m 37s) oh man (202m 39s) all the synthetic content I mean it's (202m 41s) humbling because we we treat ourselves (202m 42s) as special for being able to generate (202m 45s) art and ideas and all that kind of stuff (202m 48s) if that can be done in an automated Way (202m 50s) by AI yeah I think it's fascinating to (202m 53s) me how these uh the predictions of AI (202m 54s) and what it's going to look like and (202m 55s) what it's going to be capable of are (202m 57s) completely inverted and wrong and the (203m 0s) Sci-Fi of 50s and 60s was just like (203m 2s) totally not bright they imagined AI is (203m 4s) like super calculating theore improvers (203m 5s) and we're getting things that can talk (203m 8s) to you about emotions they can do art (203m 10s) it's just like weird are you excited (203m 13s) about that feature just ai's like hybrid (203m 16s) systems heterogeneous systems of humans (203m 19s) and AIS talking about emotions Netflix (203m 22s) and chill with an AI system legit where (203m 22s) the Netflix thing you watch is also (203m 25s) generated by AI (203m 26s) I think it's uh it's going to be (203m 29s) interesting for sure and I think I'm (203m 31s) cautiously optimistic but it's not it's (203m 33s) not obvious (203m 35s) well the sad thing is your brain and (203m 39s) mine developed in a time where (203m 42s) um before Twitter before the before the (203m 43s) internet so I wonder people that are (203m 45s) born inside of it might have a different (203m 47s) experience (203m 50s) um like I maybe you can will still (203m 52s) resist it uh and the people born now (203m 54s) will not (203m 55s) well I do feel like humans are extremely (203m 57s) malleable yeah (204m 0s) and uh you're probably right (204m 3s) what is the meaning of life Andre (204m 6s) we we talked about sort of (204m 8s) the universe having a conversation with (204m 11s) us humans or with the systems we create (204m 15s) to try to answer for the university for (204m 17s) the creator of the universe to notice us (204m 19s) we're trying to create systems that are (204m 20s) loud enough (204m 23s) just answer back (204m 24s) I don't know if that's the meaning of (204m 25s) life that's like meaning of life for (204m 27s) some people the first level answer I (204m 29s) would say is anyone can choose their own (204m 31s) meaning of life because we are conscious (204m 33s) entity and it's beautiful number one but (204m 36s) uh I do think that like a deeper meaning (204m 38s) of life if someone is interested is uh (204m 39s) or along the lines of like what the hell (204m 44s) is All This and like why and if you look (204m 45s) at the into fundamental physics and the (204m 46s) quantum field Theory and a standard (204m 50s) model they're like very complicated and (204m 50s) um (204m 52s) there's this like you know 19 free (204m 55s) parameter parameters of our universe and (204m 56s) like what's going on with all this stuff (204m 58s) and why is it here and can I hack it can (205m 0s) I work with it is there a message for me (205m 2s) am I supposed to create a message (205m 4s) and so I think there's some fundamental (205m 6s) answers there but I think there's (205m 7s) actually even like you can't actually (205m 10s) really make dent in those without more (205m 12s) time and so to me also there's a big (205m 14s) question around just getting more time (205m 15s) honestly (205m 16s) yeah that's kind of like what I think (205m 19s) about quite a bit as well so kind of the (205m 20s) ultimate (205m 22s) or at least first way to sneak up to the (205m 27s) why question is to try to escape (205m 30s) uh the system the universe yeah and then (205m 33s) for that you sort of uh backtrack and (205m 34s) say okay for that that's going to be (205m 37s) take a very long time so the why (205m 38s) question boils down from an engineering (205m 41s) perspective to how do we extend yeah I (205m 42s) think that's the question number one (205m 43s) practically speaking because you can't (205m 45s) uh you're not gonna calculate the answer (205m 48s) to the deeper questions in the time you (205m 50s) have and that could be extending your (205m 51s) own lifetime or extending just the (205m 53s) lifetime of human civilization of (205m 55s) whoever wants to not many people might (205m 58s) not want that but I think people who do (205m 59s) want that I think um I think it's (206m 2s) probably possible uh and I don't I don't (206m 3s) know that people (206m 5s) fully realize this I kind of feel like (206m 7s) people think of death as an (206m 9s) inevitability but at the end of the day (206m 11s) this is a physical system some things go (206m 13s) wrong uh it makes sense why things like (206m 16s) this happen evolutionarily speaking and (206m 18s) uh there's most certainly interventions (206m 21s) that uh that mitigate it that would be (206m 23s) interesting if death is eventually (206m 23s) looked at as (206m 26s) as a fascinating thing that used to (206m 28s) happen to humans I don't think it's (206m 31s) unlikely I think it's I think it's (206m 32s) likely (206m 36s) and it's up to our imagination to try to (206m 38s) predict what the world without death (206m 40s) looks like yeah it's hard to I think the (206m 43s) values will completely change (206m 46s) could be I don't I don't really buy all (206m 49s) these ideas that oh without that there's (206m 51s) no meaning there's nothing as (206m 53s) I don't intuitively buy all those (206m 55s) arguments I think there's plenty of (206m 57s) meaning plenty of things to learn (206m 58s) they're interesting exciting I want to (207m 0s) know I want to calculate uh I want to (207m 2s) improve the condition of (207m 5s) all the humans and organisms that are (207m 7s) alive yet the way we find meaning might (207m 9s) change we there is a lot of humans (207m 11s) probably including myself that finds (207m 14s) meaning in the finiteness of things but (207m 16s) that doesn't mean that's the only source (207m 18s) of meaning yeah I do think many people (207m 20s) will will go with that which I think is (207m 22s) great I love the idea that people can (207m 24s) just choose their own adventure like you (207m 26s) you are born as a conscious free entity (207m 29s) by default I'd like to think and um you (207m 32s) have your unalienable rights for Life uh (207m 34s) in the pursuit of happiness I don't know (207m 37s) if you have that in the nature the (207m 39s) landscape of happiness you can choose (207m 42s) your own adventure mostly and that's not (207m 44s) it's not fully true but I still am (207m 47s) pretty sure I'm an NPC but (207m 50s) um an NPC can't know it's an NPC (207m 52s) there could be different degrees and (207m 54s) levels of consciousness I don't think (207m 56s) there's a more beautiful way to end it (207m 59s) uh Andre you're an incredible person I'm (208m 1s) really honored you would talk with me (208m 2s) everything you've done for the machine (208m 5s) learning world for the AI world (208m 7s) to just inspire people to educate (208m 10s) millions of people it's been it's been (208m 11s) great and I can't wait to see what you (208m 13s) do next it's been an honor man thank you (208m 14s) so much for talking today awesome thank (208m 15s) you (208m 16s) thanks for listening to this (208m 18s) conversation with Andre karapathi to (208m 20s) support this podcast please check out (208m 23s) our sponsors in the description and now (208m 26s) let me leave you with some words from (208m 28s) Samuel Carlin (208m 30s) the purpose of models is not to fit the (208m 34s) data but to sharpen the questions (208m 37s) thanks for listening and hope to see you (208m 39s) next time (208m 39s)\"]"

       "\"think it's possible that physics has exploits and we should be trying to find them arranging some kind of a crazy quantum mechanical system that somehow gives you buffer overflow somehow gives you a rounding error in the floating Point synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development and I don't know where it leads to like at some point I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and solve it the following is a conversation with Andre capothy previously the director of AI at Tesla and before that at open Ai and Stanford he is one of the greatest scientists engineers and Educators in the history of artificial intelligence this is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors and now dear friends here's Andre capathi what is a neural network and why does it seem to uh do such a surprisingly good job of learning what is a neural network it's a mathematical abstraction of the brain I would say that's how it was originally developed at the end of the day it's a mathematical expression and it's a fairly simple mathematical expression when you get down to it it's basically a sequence of Matrix multiplies which are really dot products mathematically and some nonlinearities thrown in and so it's a very simple mathematical expression and it's got knobs in it many knobs many knobs and these knobs are Loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain they're trainable they're modifiable and so the idea is like we need to find the setting of The Knobs that makes the neural nut do whatever you want it to do like classify images and so on and so there's not too much mystery I would say in it like um you might think that basically don't want to endow it with too much meaning with respect to the brain and how it works it's really just a complicated mathematical expression with knobs and those knobs need a proper setting for it to do something uh desirable yeah but poetry is just the collection of letters with spaces but it can make us feel a certain way and in that same way when you get a large number of knobs together whether it's in a inside the brain or inside a computer they seem to they seem to surprise us with the with their power yeah I think that's fair so basically I'm underselling it by a lot because you definitely do get very surprising emergent behaviors out of these neurons when they're large enough and trained on complicated enough problems like say for example the next uh word prediction in a massive data set from the internet and then these neurons take on a pretty surprising magical properties yeah I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical formalism when your brain right now I was talking is it doing next word prediction or is it doing something more interesting well definitely some kind of a generative model that's a gpt-like and prompted by you um yeah so you're giving me a prompt and I'm kind of like responding to it in a generative way and by yourself perhaps a little bit like are you adding extra prompts from your own memory inside your head automatically feels like you're referencing some kind of a declarative structure of like memory and so on and then uh you're putting that together with your prompt and giving away some messages like how much of what you just said has been said by you before uh nothing basically right no but if you actually look at all the words you've ever said in your life and you do a search you'll probably said a lot of the same words in the same order before yeah it could be I mean I'm using phrases that are common Etc but I'm remixing it into a pretty uh sort of unique sentence at the end of the day but you're right definitely there's like a ton of remixing what you didn't you it's like Magnus Carlsen said uh I'm I'm rated 2900 whatever which is pretty decent I think you're talking very uh you're not giving enough credit to neural Nets here why do they seem to what's your best intuition about this emergent Behavior I mean it's kind of interesting because I'm simultaneously underselling them but I also feel like there's an element to which I'm over like it's actually kind of incredible that you can get so much emergent magical Behavior out of them despite them being so simple mathematically so I think those are kind of like two surprising statements that are kind of just juxtapose together and I think basically what it is is we are actually fairly good at optimizing these neural Nets and when you give them a hard enough problem they are forced to learn very interesting Solutions in the optimization and those solution basically have these immersion properties that are very interesting there's wisdom and knowledge in the knobs and so what's this representation that's in the knobs does it make sense to you intuitively the large number of knobs can hold the representation that captures some deep wisdom about the data it has looked at it's a lot of knobs it's a lot of knobs and somehow you know so speaking concretely um one of the neural Nets that people are very excited about right now are are gpts which are basically just next word prediction networks so you consume a sequence of words from the internet and you try to predict the next word and uh once you train these on a large enough data set um they you can basically uh prompt these neural amounts in arbitrary ways and you can ask them to solve problems and they will so you can just tell them you can you can make it look like you're trying to um solve some kind of a mathematical problem and they will continue what they think is the solution based on what they've seen on the internet and very often those Solutions look very remarkably consistent look correct potentially do you still think about the brain side of it so as neural Nets is an abstraction or mathematical abstraction of the brain you still draw wisdom from from the biological neural networks or even the bigger question so you're a big fan of biology and biological computation what impressive thing is biology do doing to you that computers are not yet that Gap I would say I'm definitely on I'm much more hesitant with the analogies to the brain than I think you would see potentially in the field um and I kind of feel like certainly the way neural network started is everything stemmed from inspiration by the brain but at the end of the day the artifacts that you get after training they are arrived at by a very different optimization process than the optimization process that gave rise to the brain and so I think uh I kind of think of it as a very complicated alien artifact um it's something different I'm not sorry the uh the neuralness that we're training okay they are complicated uh Alien artifact uh I do not make analogies to the brain because I think the optimization process that gave rise to it is very different from the brain so there was no multi-agent self-play kind of uh setup uh and evolution it was an optimization that is basically a what amounts to a compression objective on a massive amount of data okay so artificial neural networks are doing compression and biological neural networks are not to survive and they're not really doing any they're they're an agent in a multi-agent self-place system that's been running for a very very long time that said Evolution has found that it is very useful to to predict and have a predictive model in the brain and so I think our brain utilizes something that looks like that as a part of it but it has a lot more you know gadgets and gizmos and uh value functions and ancient nuclei that are all trying to like make a survive and reproduce and everything else and the whole thing through embryogenesis is built from a single cell I mean it's just the code is inside the DNA and it just builds it up like the entire organism yes and like it does it pretty well it should not be possible so there's some learning going on there's some there's some there's some kind of computation going through that building process I mean I I don't know where if you were just to look at the entirety of history of life on Earth where do you think is the most interesting invention is it the origin of life itself is it just jumping to eukaryotes is it mammals is it humans themselves Homo sapiens the the origin of intelligence or highly complex intelligence or or is it all just in continuation the same kind of process certainly I would say it's an extremely remarkable story that I'm only like briefly learning about recently all the way from um actually like you almost have to start at the formation of Earth and all of its conditions and the entire solar system and how everything is arranged with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable zone and everything and then you have an active Earth that's turning over material and um and then you start with a biogenesis and everything and so it's all like a pretty remarkable story I'm not sure that I can pick like a single Unique Piece of it that I find most interesting um I guess for me as an artificial intelligence researcher it's probably the last piece we have lots of animals that uh you know are are not building technological Society but we do and um it seems to have happened very quickly it seems to have happened very recently and uh something very interesting happened there that I don't fully understand I almost understand everything else kind of I think intuitively uh but I don't understand exactly that part and how quick it was both explanations would be interesting one is that this is just a continuation of the same kind of process there's nothing special about humans that would be deeply understanding that would be very interesting that we think of ourselves as special but it was obvious all it was already written in the in the code that you would have greater and greater intelligence emerging and then the other explanation which is something truly special happened something like a rare event whether it's like crazy rare event like uh Space Odyssey what would it be see if you say like the invention of Fire or the uh as Richard rangham says the beta males deciding a clever way to kill the alpha males by collaborating so just optimizing the collaborations really the multi-agent aspect of the multi-agent and that really being constrained on resources and trying to survive the collaboration aspect is what created the complex intelligence but it seems like it's a natural outgrowth of the evolution process like what could possibly be a magical thing that happened like a rare thing that would say that humans are actually human level intelligence is actually a really rare thing in the universe yeah I'm hesitant to say that it is rare by the way but it definitely seems like it's kind of like a punctuated equilibrium where you have lots of exploration and then you have certain leaps sparse leaps in between so of course like origin of life would be one um you know DNA sex eukaryotic system eukaryotic life um the endosymbiosis event or the archaeon 8 little bacteria you know just the whole thing and then of course emergence of Consciousness and so on so it seems like definitely there are sparse events where mass amount of progress was made but yeah it's kind of hard to pick one so you don't think humans are unique gotta ask you how many intelligent aliens civilizations do you think are out there and uh is there intelligence different or similar to ours yeah I've been preoccupied with this question quite a bit recently uh basically the for me Paradox and just thinking through and and the reason actually that I am very interested in uh the origin of life is fundamentally trying to understand how common it is that there are technological societies out there uh um in space and the more I study it the more I think that um uh there should be quite a few quite a lot why haven't we heard from them because I I agree with you it feels like I just don't see why what we did here on Earth is so difficult to do yeah and especially when you get into the details of it I used to think origin of life was very um it was this magical rare event but then you read books like for example McLean um uh the vital question a life ascending Etc and he really gets in and he really makes you believe that this is not that rare basic chemistry you have an active Earth and you have your alkaline Vents and you have lots of alkaline Waters mixing whether it's a devotion and you have your proton gradients and you have the little porous pockets of these alkaline vents that concentrate chemistry and um basically as he steps through all of these little pieces you start to understand that actually this is not that crazy you could see this happen on other systems um and he really takes you from just a geology to primitive life and he makes it feel like it's actually pretty plausible and also like the origin of life um didn't uh was actually fairly fast after formation of Earth um if I remember correctly just a few hundred million years or something like that after basically when it was possible life actually arose and so that makes me feel like that is not the constraint that is not the limiting variable and that life should actually be fairly common um and then it you know where the drop-offs are is very um is very interesting to think about I currently think that there's no major drop-offs basically and so there should be quite a lot of life and basically what it where that brings me to then is the only way to reconcile the fact that we haven't found anyone and so on is that um we just can't we can't see them we can't observe them just a quick brief comment Nick Lane and a lot of biologists I talked to they really seem to think that the jump from bacteria to more complex organisms is the hardest jump the eukaryotic glyphosis yeah which I don't I get it they're much more knowledgeable uh than me about like the intricacies of biology but that seems like crazy because how much how many single cell organisms are there like and how much time you have surely it's not that difficult like in a billion years it's not even that long of a time really just all these bacteria under constrained resources battling it out I'm sure they can invent more complex again I don't understand it's like how to move from a hello world program to like like invent a function or something like that I don't yeah I I so I don't yeah so I'm with you I just feel like I don't see any if the origin of life that would be my intuition that's the hardest thing but if that's not the hardest thing because it happens so quickly then it's got to be everywhere and yeah maybe we're just too dumb to see it well it's just we don't have really good mechanisms for seeing this life I mean uh by what how um so I'm not an expert just to preface this but just said it was I want to meet an expert on alien intelligence and how to communicate I'm very suspicious of our ability to to find these intelligences out there and to find these Earths like radio waves for example are are terrible uh their power drops off as basically one over R square uh so I remember reading that our current radio waves would not be uh the ones that we we are broadcasting would not be uh measurable by our devices today only like was it like one tenth of a light year away like not even basically tiny distance because you really need like a targeted transmission of massive power directed somewhere for this to be picked up on long distances and so I just think that our ability to measure is um is not amazing I think there's probably other civilizations out there and then the big question is why don't they build binomial probes and why don't they Interstellar travel across the entire galaxy and my current answer is it's probably Interstellar travel is like really hard uh you have the interstellar medium if you want to move at closer speed of light you're going to be encountering bullets along the way because even like tiny hydrogen atoms and little particles of dust are basically have like massive kinetic energy at those speeds and so basically you need some kind of shielding you need you have all the cosmic radiation uh it's just like brutal out there it's really hard and so my thinking is maybe Interstellar travel is just extremely hard to build hard it feels like uh it feels like we're not a billion years away from doing that it just might be that it's very you have to go very slowly potentially as an example through space um right as opposed to close the speed of light so I'm suspicious basically of our ability to measure life and I'm suspicious of the ability to um just permeate all of space in the Galaxy or across galaxies and that's the only way that I can certainly I can currently see a way around it yeah it's kind of mind-blowing to think that there's trillions of intelligent alien civilizations out there kind of slowly traveling through space to meet each other and some of them meet some of them go to war some of them collaborate or they're all just uh independent they are all just like little pockets I don't know well statistically if there's like if it's there's trillions of them surely some of them some of the pockets are close enough to get some of them happen to be close yeah in the close enough to see each other and then once you see once you see something that is definitely complex life like if we see something yeah we're probably going to be severe like intensely aggressively motivated to figure out what the hell that is and try to meet them what would be your first instinct to try to like at a generational level meet them or defend against them or what would be your uh Instinct as a president of the United States and the scientists I don't know which hat you prefer in this question yeah I think the the question it's really hard um I will say like for example for us um we have lots of primitive life forms on Earth um next to us we have all kinds of ants and everything else and we share space with them and we are hesitant to impact on them and to we are and we're trying to protect them by default because they are amazing interesting dynamical systems that took a long time to evolve and they are interesting and special and I don't know that you want to um destroy that by default and so I like complex dynamical systems that took a lot of time to evolve I think I'd like to I like to preserve it if I can afford to and I'd like to think that the same would be true about uh the galactic resources and that uh they would think that we're kind of incredible interesting story that took time it took a few billion years to unravel and you don't want to just destroy it I could see two aliens talking about Earth right now and saying uh I'm I'm a big fan of complex dynamical systems so I think it was a value to preserve these and who basically are a video game they watch or show a TV show that they watch yeah I think uh you would need like a very good reason I think to to destroy it uh like why don't we destroy these ant farms and so on it's because we're not actually like really in direct competition with them right now uh we do it accidentally and so on but um there's plenty of resources and so why would you destroy something that is so interesting and precious well from a scientific perspective you might probe it yeah you might interact with it later you might want to learn something from it right so I wonder there's could be certain physical phenomena that we think is a physical phenomena but it's actually interacting with us to like poke the finger and see what happens I think it should be very interesting to scientists other alien scientists what happened here um and you know it's a what we're seeing today is a snapshot basically it's a result of a huge amount of computation uh of over like billion years or something like that so it could have been initiated by aliens this could be a computer running a program like when okay if you had the power to do this when you okay for sure at least I would I would pick uh a Earth-like planet that has the conditions based my understanding of the chemistry prerequisites for life and I would see it with life and run it right like yeah wouldn't you 100 do that and observe it and then protect I mean that that's not just a hell of a good TV show it's it's a good scientific experiment yeah and that in his it's physical simulation right maybe maybe the evolution is the most like actually running it uh is the most efficient way to uh understand computation or to compute stuff or to understand life or you know what life looks like and uh what branches it can take it does make me kind of feel weird that we're part of a science experiment but maybe it's everything's a science experiments how to does that change anything for us for a science experiment um I don't know two descendants of Apes talking about being inside of a science experience I'm suspicious of this idea of like a deliberate Pence Premiere as you described it service and I don't see a divine intervention in some way in the in the historical record right now I do feel like um the story in these in these books like Nick Lane's books and so on sort of makes sense uh and it makes sense how life arose on Earth uniquely and uh yeah I don't need a I need I don't need to reach for more exotic explanations right now sure but NPCs inside a video game don't don't don't observe any divine intervention either and we might just be all NPCs running a kind of code maybe eventually they will currently NPCs are really dumb but once they're running gpts um maybe they will be like hey this is really suspicious what the hell so you uh famously tweeted it looks like if you bombard Earth with photons for a while you can emit A roadster so if like an Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy we would summarize the story of Earth so in in that book it's mostly harmless uh what do you think is all the possible stories like a paragraph long or a sentence long that Earth could be summarized as once it's done it's computation so like all the Possible full if Earth is a book right yeah uh probably there has to be an ending I mean there's going to be an end to Earth and it could end in all kinds of ways it could end soon it can end later what do you think are the possible stories well definitely there seems to be yeah you're sort of it's pretty incredible that these self-replicating systems will basically arise from the Dynamics and then they perpetuate themselves and become more complex and eventually become conscious and build a society and I kind of feel like in some sense it's kind of like a deterministic wave uh that you know that kind of just like happens on any you know any sufficiently well arranged system like Earth and so I kind of feel like there's a certain sense of inevitability in it um and it's really beautiful and it ends somehow right so it's a it's a chemically a diverse environment where complex dynamical systems can evolve and become more more further and further complex but then there's a certain um what is it there's certain terminating conditions yeah I don't know what the terminating conditions are but definitely there's a trend line of something and we're part of that story and like where does that where does it go so you know we're famously described often as a biological Bootloader for AIS and that's because humans I mean you know we're an incredible uh biological system and we're capable of computation and uh you know and love and so on um but we're extremely inefficient as well like we're talking to each other through audio it's just kind of embarrassing honestly they were manipulating like seven symbols uh serially we're using vocal chords it's all happening over like multiple seconds yeah it's just like kind of embarrassing when you step down to the uh frequencies at which computers operate or are able to cooperate on and so basically it does seem like um synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development and um I don't know where it leads to like at some point I suspect uh the universe is some kind of a puzzle and these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and um solve it and then what happens after right like what because if you just like Fast Forward Earth many billions of years it's like uh it's quiet and then it's like to tourmal you see like city lights and stuff like that and then what happens like at the end like is it like a is it or is it like a calming is it explosion is it like Earth like open like a giant because you said emit Roasters like well let's start emitting like like a giant number of Like Satellites yes it's some kind of a crazy explosion and we're living we're like we're stepping through a explosion and we're like living day to day and it doesn't look like it but it's actually if you I saw a very cool animation of Earth uh and life on Earth and basically nothing happens for a long time and then the last like two seconds like basically cities and everything and just in the low earth orbit just gets cluttered and just the whole thing happens in the last two seconds and you're like this is exploding this is a statement explosion so if you play yeah yeah if you play it at normal speed yeah it'll just look like an explosion it's a firecracker we're living in a firecracker where it's going to start emitting all kinds of interesting things yeah and then so explosion doesn't it might actually look like a little explosion with with lights and fire and energy emitted all that kind of stuff but when you look inside the details of the explosion there's actual complexity happening where there's like uh yeah human life or some kind of life we hope it's not destructive firecracker it's kind of like a constructive uh firecracker all right so given that I think uh hilarious disgusting it is a really interesting to think about like what the puzzle of the universe is that the creator of the universe uh give us a message like for example in the book contact UM Carl Sagan uh there's a message for Humanity for any civilization in uh digits in the expansion of Pi and base 11 eventually which is kind of interesting thought uh maybe maybe we're supposed to be giving a message to our creator maybe we're supposed to somehow create some kind of a quantum mechanical system that alerts them to our intelligent presence here because if you think about it from their perspective it's just say like Quantum field Theory massive like cellular automaton like thing and like how do you even notice that we exist you might not even be able to pick us up in that simulation and so how do you uh how do you prove that you exist that you're intelligent and that you're a part of the universe so this is like a touring test for intelligence from Earth yeah the Creator is uh I mean maybe this is uh like trying to complete the next word in a sentence this is a complicated way of that like Earth is just is basically sending a message back yeah the puzzle is basically like alerting the Creator that we exist or maybe the puzzle is just to just break out of the system and just uh you know stick it to the Creator in some way uh basically like if you're playing a video game you can um you can somehow find an exploit and find a way to execute on the host machine in the arbitrary code there's some for example I believe someone got Mario a game of Mario to play Pong just by uh exploiting it and then um creating a basically writing writing code and being able to execute arbitrary code in the game and so maybe we should be maybe that's the puzzle is that we should be um uh find a way to exploit it so so I think like some of these synthetic ads will eventually find the universe to be some kind of a puzzle and then solve it in some way and that's kind of like the end game somehow do you often think about it as a as a simulation so as the universe being a kind of computation that has might have bugs and exploits yes yeah I think so is that what physics is essentially I think it's possible that physics has exploits and we should be trying to find them arranging some kind of a crazy quantum mechanical system that somehow gives you buffer overflow somehow gives you a rounding error and a floating Point uh yeah that's right and like more and more sophisticated exploits like those are jokes but that could be actually very close yeah we'll find some way to extract infinite energy for example when you train a reinforcement learning agents um and physical simulations and you ask them to say run quickly on the flat ground they'll end up doing all kinds of like weird things um in part of that optimization right they'll get on their back leg and they will slide across the floor and it's because of the optimization the enforcement learning optimization on that agent has figured out a way to extract infinite energy from the friction forces and basically their poor implementation and they found a way to generate infinite energy and just slide across the surface and it's not what you expected it's just a it's sort of like a perverse solution and so maybe we can find something like that maybe we can be that little dog in this physical simulation the the cracks or escapes the intended consequences of the physics that the Universe came up with we'll figure out some kind of shortcut to some weirdness yeah and then oh man but see the problem with that weirdness is the first person to discover the weirdness like sliding in the back legs that's all we're going to do yeah it's very quickly because everybody does that thing so like the the paper clip maximizer is a ridiculous idea but that very well you know could be what then we'll just uh we'll just all switch that because it's so fun well no person will Discover it I think by the way I think it's going to have to be uh some kind of a super intelligent AGI of a third generation like we're building the first generation AGI you know third generation yeah so the the Bootloader for an AI the that AI yeah will be a Bootloader for another AI yeah and then there's no way for us to introspect like what that might even uh I think it's very likely that these things for example like say you have these agis it's very like for example they will be completely inert I like these kinds of sci-fi books sometimes where these things are just completely inert they don't interact with anything and I find that kind of beautiful because uh they probably they've probably figured out the meta game of the universe in some way potentially they're they're doing something completely beyond our imagination um and uh they don't interact with simple chemical life forms like why would you do that so I find those kinds of ideas compelling what's their source of fun what are they what are they doing what's the source of solving in the universe but inert so can you define what it means inert so they escape as in um they will behave in some very like strange way to us because they're uh they're beyond they're playing The Meta game uh and The Meta game is probably say like arranging quantum mechanical systems in some very weird ways to extract Infinite Energy uh solve the digital expansion of Pi to whatever amount uh they will build their own like little Fusion reactors or something crazy like they're doing something Beyond Comprehension and uh not understandable to us and actually brilliant under the hood what if quantum mechanics itself is the system and we're just thinking it's physics but we're really parasites on on or not parasite we're not really hurting physics we're just living on this organisms this organism and we're like trying to understand it but really it is an organism and with a deep deep intelligence maybe physics itself is uh the the organism that's doing a super interesting thing and we're just like one little thing yeah ant sitting on top of it trying to get energy from it we're just kind of like these particles in a wave that I feel like is mostly deterministic and takes uh Universe from some kind of a big bang to some kind of a super intelligent replicator some kind of a stable point in the universe given these laws of physics you don't think uh as Einstein said God doesn't play dice so you think it's mostly deterministic there's no Randomness in the thing I think it's deterministic oh there's tons of uh well I'm I want to be careful with Randomness pseudo random yeah I don't like random uh I think maybe the laws of physics are deterministic um yeah I think they're determinants just got really uncomfortable with this question do you have anxiety about whether the universe is random or not what's there's no Randomness uh you say you like Goodwill Hunting it's not your fault Andre it's not it's not your fault man um so you don't like Randomness uh yeah I think it's uh unsettling I think it's a deterministic system I think that things that look random like say the uh collapse of the wave function Etc I think they're actually deterministic just entanglement uh and so on and uh some kind of a Multiverse Theory something something okay so why does it feel like we have a free will like if I raise the hand I chose to do this now um what that doesn't feel like a deterministic thing it feels like I'm making a choice it feels like it okay so it's all feelings it's just feelings yeah so when an RL agent is making a choice is that um it's not really making a choice the choices are all already there yeah you're interpreting the choice and you're creating a narrative for or having made it yeah and now we're talking about the narrative it's very meta looking back what is the most beautiful or surprising idea in deep learning or AI in general that you've come across you've seen this field explode and grow in interesting ways just what what cool ideas like like we made you sit back and go hmm small big or small well the one that I've been thinking about recently the most probably is the the Transformer architecture um so basically uh neural networks have a lot of architectures that were trendy have come and gone for different sensory modalities like for Vision Audio text you would process them with different looking neural nuts and recently we've seen these convergence towards one architecture the Transformer and you can feed it video or you can feed it you know images or speech or text and it just gobbles it up and it's kind of like a bit of a general purpose uh computer that is also trainable and very efficient to run on our Hardware and so uh this paper came out in 2016 I want to say um attention is all you need attention is all you need you criticize the paper title in retrospect that it wasn't um it didn't foresee the bigness of the impact yeah that it was going to have yeah I'm not sure if the authors were aware of the impact that that paper would go on to have probably they weren't but I think they were aware of some of the motivations and design decisions beyond the Transformer and they chose not to I think expand on it in that way in the paper and so I think they had an idea that there was more um than just the surface of just like oh we're just doing translation and here's a better architecture you're not just doing translation this is like a really cool differentiable optimizable efficient computer that you've proposed and maybe they didn't have all of that foresight but I think is really interesting isn't it funny sorry to interrupt that title is memeable that they went for such a profound idea they went with the I don't think anyone used that kind of title before right protection is all you need yeah it's like a meme or something exactly it's not funny that one like uh maybe if it was a more serious title it wouldn't have the impact honestly I yeah there is an element of me that honestly agrees with you and prefers it this way yes if it was two grand it would over promise and then under deliver potentially so you want to just uh meme your way to greatness that should be a t-shirt so you you tweeted the Transformers the Magnificent neural network architecture because it is a general purpose differentiable computer it is simultaneously expressive in the forward pass optimizable via back propagation gradient descent and efficient High parallelism compute graph can you discuss some of those details expressive optimizable efficient yeah for memory or or in general whatever comes to your heart you want to have a general purpose computer that you can train on arbitrary problems like say the task of next word prediction or detecting if there's a cat in the image or something like that and you want to train this computer so you want to set its weights and I think there's a number of design criteria that sort of overlap in the Transformer simultaneously that made it very successful and I think the authors were kind of uh deliberately trying to make this really powerful architecture and um so basically it's very powerful in the forward pass because it's able to express um very general computation as a sort of something that looks like message passing you have nodes and they all store vectors and these nodes get to basically look at each other and it's each other's vectors and they get to communicate and basically notes get to broadcast hey I'm looking for certain things and then other nodes get to broadcast hey these are the things I have those are the keys and the values so it's not just the tension yeah exactly Transformer is much more than just the attention component it's got many pieces architectural that went into it the residual connection of the way it's arranged there's a multi-layer perceptron in there the way it's stacked and so on um but basically there's a message passing scheme where nodes get to look at each other decide what's interesting and then update each other and uh so I think the um when you get to the details of it I think it's a very expressive function uh so it can express lots of different types of algorithms and forward paths not only that but the way it's designed with the residual connections layer normalizations the softmax attention and everything it's also optimizable this is a really big deal because there's lots of computers that are powerful that you can't optimize or they're not easy to optimize using the techniques that we have which is back propagation and gradient and send these are first order methods very simple optimizers really and so um you also need it to be optimizable um and then lastly you want it to run efficiently in the hardware our Hardware is a massive throughput machine like gpus they prefer lots of parallelism so you don't want to do lots of sequential operations you want to do a lot of operations serially and the Transformer is designed with that in mind as well and so it's designed for our hardware and it's designed to both be very expressive in a forward pass but also very optimizable in the backward pass and you said that uh the residual connections support a kind of ability to learn short algorithms fast them first and then gradually extend them longer during training yeah what's what's the idea of learning short algorithms right think of it as a so basically a Transformer is a series of uh blocks right and these blocks have attention and a little multi-layer perceptron and so you you go off into a block and you come back to this residual pathway and then you go off and you come back and then you have a number of layers arranged sequentially and so the way to look at it I think is because of the residual pathway in the backward path the gradients uh sort of flow along it uninterrupted because addition distributes the gradient equally to all of its branches so the gradient from the supervision at the top uh just floats directly to the first layer and the all the residual connections are arranged so that in the beginning during initialization they contribute nothing to the residual pathway um so what it kind of looks like is imagine the Transformer is kind of like a uh python uh function like a death and um you get to do various kinds of like lines of code say you have a hundred layers deep Transformer typically they would be much shorter say 20. so if 20 lines of code then you can do something in them and so think of during the optimization basically what it looks like is first you optimize the first line of code and then the second line of code can kick in and the third line of code can and I kind of feel like because of the residual pathway and the Dynamics of the optimization you can sort of learn a very short algorithm that gets the approximate tensor but then the other layers can sort of kick in and start to create a contribution and at the end of it you're you're optimizing over an algorithm that is 20 lines of code except these lines of code are very complex because it's an entire block of a transformer you can do a lot in there what's really interesting is that this Transformer architecture actually has been a remarkably resilient basically the Transformer that came out in 2016 is the Transformer you would use today except you reshuffle some of the layer norms the layer normalizations have been reshuffled to a pre-norm formulation and so it's been remarkably stable but there's a lot of bells and whistles that people have attached on and try to uh improve it I do think that basically it's a it's a big step in simultaneously optimizing for lots of properties of a desirable neural network architecture and I think people have been trying to change it but it's proven remarkably resilient but I do think that there should be even better architectures potentially but it's uh your you admire the resilience here yeah there's something profound about this architecture that that at least so maybe we can everything can be turned into a uh into a problem that Transformers can solve currently definitely looks like the Transformers taking over Ai and you can feed basically arbitrary problems into it and it's a general differentiable computer and it's extremely powerful and uh this convergence in AI has been really interesting to watch uh for me personally what else do you think could be discovered here about Transformers like what's surprising thing or or is it a stable um I went to stable place is there something interesting we might discover about Transformers like aha moments maybe has to do with memory uh maybe knowledge representation that kind of stuff definitely the Zeitgeist today is just pushing like basically right now this ad guys is do not touch the Transformer touch everything else yes so people are scaling up the data sets making them much much bigger they're working on the evaluation making the evaluation much much bigger and uh um they're basically keeping the architecture unchanged and that's how we've um that's the last five years of progress in AI kind of what do you think about one flavor of it which is language models have you been surprised uh has your sort of imagination been captivated by you mentioned GPT and all the bigger and bigger and bigger language models and uh what are the limits of those models do you think so just let the task of natural language basically the way GPT is trained right is you just download a mass amount of text Data from the internet and you try to predict the next word in a sequence roughly speaking you're predicting will work chunks but uh roughly speaking that's it and what's been really interesting to watch is uh basically it's a language model language models have actually existed for a very long time um there's papers on language modeling from 2003 even earlier can you explain that case what a language model is uh yeah so language model just basically the rough idea is um just predicting the next word in a sequence roughly speaking uh so there's a paper from for example bengio and the team from 2003 where for the first time they were using a neural network to take say like three or five words and predict the um next word and they're doing this on much smaller data sets and the neural net is not a Transformer it's a multiple error perceptron but but it's the first time that a neural network has been applied in that setting but even before neural networks there were language models except they were using engram models so engram models are just a count based models so um if you try to if you start to take two words and predict the third one you just count up how many times you've seen any two word combinations and what came next and what you predict that's coming next is just what you've seen the most of in the training set and so language modeling has been around for a long time neural networks have done language modeling for a long time so really what's new or interesting or exciting is just realizing that when you scale it up with a powerful enough neural net Transformer you have all these emergent properties where basically what happens is if you have a large enough data set of text you are in the task of predicting the next word you are multitasking a huge amount of different kinds of problems you are multitasking understanding of you know chemistry physics human nature lots of things are sort of clustered in that objective it's a very simple objective but actually you have to understand a lot about the world to make that prediction you just said the U word understanding uh are you in terms of chemistry and physics and so on what do you feel like it's doing is it searching for the right context uh in in like what what is it what is the actual process Happening Here Yeah so basically it gets a thousand words and it's trying to predict a thousand at first and uh in order to do that very very well over the entire data set available on the internet you actually have to basically kind of understand the context of of what's going on in there yeah um and uh it's a sufficiently hard problem that you uh if you have a powerful enough computer like a Transformer you end up with uh interesting Solutions and uh you can ask it uh to all do all kinds of things and um it it shows a lot of emerging properties like in context learning that was the big deal with GPT and the original paper when they published it is that you can just sort of uh prompt it in various ways and ask it to do various things and it will just kind of complete the sentence but in the process of just completing the sentence it's actually solving all kinds of really uh interesting problems that we care about do you think it's doing something like understanding like and when we use the word understanding for us humans I think it's doing some understanding it in its weights it understands I think a lot about the world and it has to in order to predict the next word in a sequence so let's train on the data from the internet uh what do you think about this this approach in terms of data sets of using data from the internet do you think the internet has enough structured data to teach AI about human civilization yeah so I think the internet has a huge amount of data I'm not sure if it's a complete enough set I don't know that uh text is enough for having a sufficiently powerful AGI as an outcome um of course there is audio and video and images and all that kind of stuff yeah so text by itself I'm a little bit suspicious about there's a ton of things we don't put in text in writing uh just because they're obvious to us about how the world works and the physics of it and the Things fall we don't put that stuff in text because why would you we share that understanding and so Texas communication medium between humans and it's not a all-encompassing medium of knowledge about the world but as you pointed out we do have video and we have images and we have audio and so I think that that definitely helps a lot but we haven't trained models uh sufficiently uh across both across all those modalities yet so I think that's what a lot of people are interested in but I wonder what that shared understanding of like well we might call Common Sense has to be learned inferred in order to complete the sentence correctly so maybe the fact that it's implied on the internet the model is going to have to learn that not by reading about it by inferring it in the representation so like common sense just like we I don't think we learn common sense like nobody says tells us explicitly we just figure it all out by interacting with the world right so here's a model of reading about the way people interact with the world it might have to infer that I wonder yeah uh you you briefly worked on a project called the world of bits training in our RL system to take actions on the internet versus just consuming the internet like we talked about do you think there's a future for that kind of system interacting with the internet to help the learning yes I think that's probably the uh the final frontier for a lot of these models because um so as you mentioned I was at open AI I was working on this project world of bits and basically it was the idea of giving neural networks access to a keyboard and a mouse and the idea could possibly go wrong so basically you um you perceive the input of the screen pixels and basically the state of the computer is sort of visualized for human consumption in images of the web browser and stuff like that and then you give the neural network the ability to press keyboards and use the mouse and we're trying to get it to for example complete bookings and you know interact with user interfaces and um what did you learn from that experience like what was some fun stuff this is super cool idea yeah I mean it's like uh yeah I mean the the step between Observer to actor yeah is a super fascinating step yeah well the universal interface in the digital realm I would say and there's a universal interface in like the Physical Realm which in my mind is a humanoid form factor kind of thing we can later talk about Optimus and so on but I feel like there's a they're kind of like a similar philosophy in some way where the human the world the physical world is designed for the human form and the digital world is designed for the human form of seeing the screen and using keyword keyboard and mouse and so as the universal interface that can basically uh command the digital infrastructure we've built up for ourselves and so it feels like a very powerful interface to to command and to build on top of now to your question as to like what I learned from that it's interesting because the world of bits was basically uh too early I think at open AI at the time this is around 2015 or so and the Zeitgeist at that time was very different in AI from the Zeitgeist today at the time everyone was super excited about reinforcement learning from scratch this is the time of the Atari paper where uh neural networks were playing Atari games and beating humans in some cases uh alphago and so on so everyone's very excited about train training neural networks from scratch using reinforcement learning um directly it turns out that reinforcement learning is extremely inefficient way of training neural networks because you're taking all these actions and all these observations and you get some sparse rewards once in a while so you do all this stuff based on all these inputs and once in a while you're like told you did a good thing you did a bad thing and it's just an extremely hard problem you can't learn from that you can burn forest and you can sort of Brute Force through it and we saw that I think with uh you know with uh go and DOTA and so on and it does work but it's extremely inefficient uh and not how you want to approach problems uh practically speaking and so that's the approach that at the time we also took to World of bits we would uh have an agent initialize randomly so with keyboard mash and mouse mash and try to make a booking and it's just like revealed the insanity of that approach very quickly where you have to stumble by the correct booking in order to get a reward of you did it correctly and you're never going to stumble by it by chance at random so even with a simple web interface there's too many options there's just too many options uh and uh it's two sparse of reward signal and you're starting from scratch at the time and so you don't know how to read you don't understand pictures images buttons you don't understand what it means to like make a booking but now what's happened is uh it is time to revisit that and open your eyes interested in this uh companies like Adept are interested in this and so on and uh the idea is coming back because the interface is very powerful but now you're not training an agent from scratch you are taking the GPT as an initialization so GPT is pre-trained on all of text and it understands what's a booking it understands what's a submit it understands um quite a bit more and so it already has those representations they are very powerful and that makes all the training significantly more efficient and makes the problem tractable should the interaction be with like the way humans see it with the buttons and the language or it should be with the HTML JavaScript and this and the CSS what's what do you think is the better so today all this interest is mostly on the level of HTML CSS and so on that's done because of computational constraints but I think ultimately everything is designed for human visual consumption and so at the end of the day there's all the additional information is in the layout of the web page and what's next to you and what's a red background and all this kind of stuff and what it looks like visually so I think that's the final frontier as we are taking in pixels and we're giving out keyboard mouse commands but I think it's impractical still today do you worry about bots on the internet given given these ideas given how exciting they are do you worry about bots on Twitter being not the the stupid boss that we see now with the cryptobots but the Bots that might be out there actually that we don't see that they're interacting in interesting ways so this kind of system feels like it should be able to pass the I'm not a robot click button whatever um which you actually understand how that test works I don't quite like there's there's a there's a check box or whatever that you click it's presumably tracking oh I see like Mouse movement and the timing and so on yeah so exactly this kind of system we're talking about should be able to pass that so yeah what do you feel about um Bots that are language models Plus have some interact ability and are able to tweet and reply and so on do you worry about that world uh yeah I think it's always been a bit of an arms race uh between sort of the attack and the defense uh so the attack will get stronger but the defense will get stronger as well our ability to detect that how do you defend how do you detect how do you know that your karpate account on Twitter is is human how do you approach that like if people were claim you know uh how would you defend yourself in the court of law that I'm a human um this account is yeah at some point I think uh it might be I think the society Society will evolve a little bit like we might start signing digitally signing uh some of our correspondents or you know things that we create uh right now it's not necessary but maybe in the future it might be I do think that we are going towards the world where we share we share the digital space with uh AIS synthetic beings yeah and uh they will get much better and they will share our digital realm and they'll eventually share our Physical Realm as well it's much harder uh but that's kind of like the world we're going towards and most of them will be benign and awful and some of them will be malicious and it's going to be an arms race trying to detect them so I mean the worst isn't the AI is the worst is the AIS pretending to be human so mine I don't know if it's always malicious there's obviously a lot of malicious applications but yeah it could also be you know if I was an AI I would try very hard to pretend to be human because we're in a human world yeah I wouldn't get any respect as an AI yeah I want to get some love and respect I don't think the problem is intractable people are people are thinking about the proof of personhood yes and uh we might start digitally signing our stuff and we might all end up having like uh yeah basically some some solution for proof of personhood it doesn't seem to be intractable it's just something that we haven't had to do until now but I think once the need like really starts to emerge which is soon I think when people think about it much more so but that too will be a race because um obviously you can probably uh spoof or fake the the the proof of personhood so you have to try to figure out how to probably I mean it's weird that we have like Social Security numbers and like passports and stuff it seems like it's harder to fake stuff in the physical space than the residual space it just feels like it's going to be very tricky very tricky to out um because it seems to be pretty low cost fake stuff what are you gonna put an AI in jail for like trying to use a fake fake personhood proof you can I mean okay fine you'll put a lot of AIS in jail but there'll be more ai's arbitrary like exponentially more the cost of creating a bot is very low uh unless there's some kind of way to track accurately like you're not allowed to create any program without showing uh tying yourself to that program like you any program that runs on the internet you'll be able to uh Trace every single human program that was involved with that program yeah maybe you have to start declaring when uh you know we have to start drawing those boundaries and keeping track of okay uh what our digital entities versus human entities and uh what is the ownership of human entities and digital entities and uh something like that um I don't know but I think I'm optimistic that this is uh this is uh possible and at some in some sense we're currently in like the worst time of it because um all these Bots suddenly have become very capable but we don't have defenses yet built up as a society and but I think uh that doesn't seem to be intractable it's just something that we have to deal with it seems weird that the Twitter but like really crappy Twitter Bots are so numerous like is it so I presume that the engineers at Twitter are very good so it seems like what I would infer from that uh is it seems like a hard problem it they're probably catching all right if I were to sort of steal them on the case it's a hard problem and there's a huge cost to uh false positive to to removing a post by somebody that's not a bot because creates a very bad user experience so they're very cautious about removing so maybe it's uh and maybe the boss are really good at learning what gets removed and not such that they can stay ahead of the removal process very quickly my impression of it honestly is there's a lot of blowing for it I mean yeah just that's what I it's not subtle it's my impression of it it's not so but you have to yeah that's my impression as well but it feels like maybe you're seeing the the tip of the iceberg maybe the number of bots is in like the trillions and you have to like just it's a constant assault of bots and yeah you yeah I don't know um you have to still man the case because the boss I'm seeing are pretty like obvious I could write a few lines of code that catch these Bots I mean definitely there's a lot of longing fruit but I will say I agree that if you are a sophisticated actor you could probably create a pretty good bot right now um you know using tools like gpts because it's a language model you can generate faces that look quite good now uh and you can do this at scale and so I think um yeah it's quite plausible and it's going to be hard to defend there was a Google engineer that claimed that the Lambda was sentient do you think there's any inkling of Truth to what he felt and more importantly to me at least do you think language models will achieve sentence or the illusion of sentience soonish fish yeah to me it's a little bit of a canary Nicole mine kind of moment honestly a little bit because uh so this engineer spoke to like a chatbot at Google and uh became convinced that uh this bot is sentient yeah as there's some existential philosophical questions and it gave like reasonable answers and looked real and uh and so on so to me it's a uh he was he was uh he wasn't sufficiently trying to stress the system I think and uh exposing the truth of it as it is today um but uh I think this will be increasingly harder over time uh so uh yeah I think more and more people will basically uh become um yeah I think more and more there will be more people like that over time as this gets better like form an emotional connection to to an AI yeah perfectly plausible in my mind I think these AIS are actually quite good at human human connection human emotion a ton of text on the Internet is about humans and connection and love and so on so I think they have a very good understanding in some in some sense of of how people speak to each other about this and um they're very capable of creating a lot of that kind of text the um there's a lot of like sci-fi from 50s and 60s that imagined AIS in a very different way they are calculating cold vulcan-like machines that's not what we're getting today we're getting pretty emotional AIS that actually uh are very competent and capable of generating you know possible sounding text with respect to all of these topics see I'm really hopeful about AI systems that are like companions that help you grow develop as a human being help you maximize long-term happiness but I'm also very worried about AI systems that figure out from the internet the humans get attracted to drama and so these would just be like shit talking AIS that's just constantly did you hear like they'll do gossip they'll do uh they'll try to plant seeds of Suspicion to like other humans that you love and trust and just kind of mess with people uh in the you know because because that's going to get a lot of attention so drama maximize drama on the path to maximizing uh engagement and US humans will feed into that machine yeah and get it'll be a giant drama shitstorm so I'm worried about that so it's the objective function really defines the way that human civilization progresses with AIS in it yeah I think right now at least today they are not sort of it's not correct to really think of them as goal seeking agents that want to do something they have no long-term memory or anything they it's literally a good approximation of it is you get a thousand words and you're trying to predict a thousand at first and then you continue feeding it in and you are free to prompt it in whatever way you want so in text so you say okay you are a psychologist and you are very good and you love humans and here's a conversation between you and another human human colon Something you something and then it just continues the pattern and suddenly you're having a conversation with a fake psychologist who's not trying to help you and so it's still kind of like in a realm of a tool it is a um people can prompt their arbitrary ways and it can create really incredible text but it doesn't have long-term goals over long periods of time it doesn't try to uh so it doesn't look that way right now yeah but you can do short-term goals that have long-term effects so if my prompting short-term goal is to get Andre capacity to respond to me on Twitter when I like I think AI might that's the goal but he might figure out that talking shit to you it would be the best in a highly sophisticating interesting way and then you build up a relationship when you respond once and then it like over time it gets to not be sophisticated and just like just talk shit and okay maybe you won't get to Andre but it might get to another celebrity it might get into other big accounts and then it'll just so with just that simple goal get them to respond yeah maximize the probability of actual response yeah I mean you could prompt a uh powerful model like this with their its opinion about how to do any possible thing you're interested in so they will discuss they're kind of on track to become these oracles I could I sort of think of it that way they are oracles uh currently is just text but they will have calculators they will have access to Google search they will have all kinds of couches and gizmos they will be able to operate the internet and find different information and um yeah in some sense that's kind of like currently what it looks like in terms of the development do you think it'll be an improvement eventually over what Google is for access to human knowledge like it'll be a more effective search engine to access human knowledge I think there's definite scope in building a better search engine today and I think Google they have all the tools all the people they have everything they need they have all the puzzle pieces they have people training Transformers at scale they have all the data uh it's just not obvious if they are capable as an organization to innovate on their search engine right now and if they don't someone else will there's absolute scope for building a significantly better search engine built on these tools it's so interesting a large company where the search there's already an infrastructure it works as it brings out a lot of money so where structurally inside a company is their motivation to Pivot yeah to say we're going to build a new search engine yep that's really hard so it's usually going to come from a startup right that's um that would be yeah or some other more competent organization um so uh I don't know so currently for example maybe Bing has another shot at it you know so Microsoft Edge because we're talking offline um I mean I definitely it's really interesting because search engines used to be about okay here's some query here's here's here's web pages that look like the stuff that you have but you could just directly go to answer and then have supporting evidence um and these uh these models basically they've read all the texts and they've read all the web pages and so sometimes when you see yourself going over to search results and sort of getting like a sense of like the average answer to whatever you're interested in uh like that just directly comes out you don't have to do that work um so they're kind of like uh yeah I think they have a way to this of distilling all that knowledge into like some level of insight basically do you think of prompting as a kind of teaching and learning like this whole process like another layer you know because maybe that's what humans are we already have that background model and then your the world is prompting you yeah exactly I think the way we are programming these computers now like gpts is is converging to how you program humans I mean how do I program humans via prompt I go to people and I I prompt them to do things I prompt them from information and so uh natural language prompt is how we program humans and we're starting to program computers directly in that interface it's like pretty remarkable honestly so you've spoken a lot about the idea of software 2.0 um all good ideas become like cliches so quickly like the terms it's kind of hilarious um it's like I think Eminem once said that like if he gets annoyed by a song He's written very quickly that means it's going to be a big hit because it's it's too catchy but uh can you describe this idea and how you're thinking about it has evolved over the months and years since since you coined it yeah yeah so I had a blog post on software 2.0 I think several years ago now um and the reason I wrote that post is because I kept I kind of saw something remarkable happening in like software development and how a lot of code was being transitioned to be written not in sort of like C plus and so on but it's written in the weights of a neural net basically just saying that neural Nets are taking over software the realm of software and uh taking more and more tasks and at the time I think not many people understood uh this uh deeply enough that this is a big deal it's a big transition uh neural networks were seen as one of multiple classification algorithms you might use for your data set problem on kaggle like this is not that this is a change in how we program computers and I saw neural Nets as uh this is going to take over the way we program computers is going to change is not going to be people writing a software in C plus or something like that and directly programming the software it's going to be accumulating training sets and data sets and crafting these objectives by which we train these neural Nets and at some point there's going to be a compilation process from the data sets and the objective and the architecture specification into the binary which is really just uh the neural nut you know weights and the forward pass of the neural net and then you can deploy that binary and so I was talking about that sort of transition and uh that's what the post is about and I saw this sort of play out in a lot of fields uh you know autopilot being one of them but also just a simple image classification people thought originally you know in the 80s and so on that they would write the algorithm for detecting a dog in an image and they had all these ideas about how the brain does it and first we detected corners and then we detect lines and then we stitched them up and they were like really going at it they were like thinking about how they're going to write the algorithm and this is not the way you build it and there was a smooth transition where okay first we thought we were going to build everything then we were building the features uh so like Hawk features and things like that that detect these little statistical patterns from image patches and then there was a little bit of learning on top of it like a support Vector machine or binary classifier for cat versus dog and images on top of the features so we wrote the features but we trained the last layer sort of the the classifier and then people are like actually let's not even design the features because we can't honestly we're not very good at it so let's also learn the features and then you end up with basically a convolutional neural net where you're learning most of it you're just specifying the architecture and the architecture has tons of fill in the blanks which is all the knobs and you let the optimization write most of it and so this transition is happening across the industry everywhere and uh suddenly we end up with a ton of code that is written in neural net weights and I was just pointing out that the analogy is actually pretty strong and we have a lot of developer environments for software 1.0 like we have Ides um how you work with code how you debug code how do you how do you run code how do you maintain code we have GitHub so I was trying to make those analogies in the new realm like what is the GitHub or software 2.0 it turns out that something that looks like hugging face right now uh you know and so I think some people took it seriously and built cool companies and uh many people originally attacked the post it actually was not well received when I wrote it and I think maybe it has something to do with the title but the post was not well received and I think more people sort of have been coming around to it over time yeah so you were the director of AI at Tesla where I think this idea was really implemented at scale which is how you have engineering teams doing software 2.0 so can you sort of Linger on that idea of I think we're in the really early stages of everything you just said which is like GitHub Ides like how do we build engineering teams that that work in software 2.0 systems and and the the data collection and the data annotation which is all part of that software 2.0 like what do you think is the task of programming a software 2.0 is it debugging in the space of hyper parameters or is it also debugging the space of data yeah the way by which you program the computer and influence its algorithm is not by writing the commands yourself you're changing mostly the data set uh you're changing the um loss functions of like what the neural net is trying to do how it's trying to predict things but yeah basically the data sets and the architectures of the neural net and um so in the case of the autopilot a lot of the data sets have to do with for example detection of objects and Lane line markings and traffic lights and so on So You accumulate massive data sets of here's an example here's the desired label and then uh here's roughly how the architect here's roughly what the algorithm should look like and that's a conclusional neural net so the specification of the architecture is like a hint as to what the algorithm should roughly look like and then to fill in the blanks process of optimization is the training process and then you take your neural nut that was trained it gives all the right answers on your data set and you deploy it so there's in that case perhaps it all machine learning cases there's a lot of tasks so is coming up formulating a task like uh for a multi-headed neural network is formulating a task part of the programming yeah very much so how you break down a problem into a set of tasks yeah I'm on a high level I would say if you look at the software running in in the autopilot I gave a number of talks on this topic I would say originally a lot of it was written in software 1.0 there's imagine lots of C plus plus all right and then gradually there was a tiny neural net that was for example predicting given a single image is there like a traffic light or not or is there a landline marking or not and this neural net didn't have too much to do in this in the scope of the software it was making tiny predictions on individual little image and then the rest of the system stitched it up so okay we're actually we don't have just a single camera with eight cameras we actually have eight cameras over time and so what do you do with these predictions how do you put them together how do you do the fusion of all that information and how do you act on it all of that was written by humans um in C plus and then we decided okay we don't actually want uh to do all of that Fusion in C plus code because we're actually not good enough to write that algorithm we want the neural Nets to write the algorithm and we want to Port uh all of that software into the 2.0 stack and so then we actually had neural Nets that now take all the eight camera images simultaneously and make predictions for all of that so um and and actually they don't make predictions in a in the space of images they now make predictions directly in 3D and actually they don't in three dimensions around the car and now actually we don't um manually fuse the predictions over in 3D over time we don't trust ourselves to write that tracker so actually we give the neural net uh the information over time so it takes these videos now and makes those predictions and so your sort of just like putting more and more power into the neural network processing and at the end of it the eventual sort of goal is to have most of the software potentially be in the 2.0 land um because it works significantly better humans are just not very good at writing software basically so the prediction is space happening in this like 4D land yeah was three-dimensional world over time yeah how do you do annotation in that world what what have you as it's just a data annotation whether it's self-supervised or manual by humans is um is a big part of this software 2.0 world right I would say by far in the industry if you're like talking about the industry and how what is the technology of what we have available everything is supervised learning so you need data sets of input desired output and you need lots of it and um there are three properties of it that you need you need it to be very large you need it to be accurate No mistakes and you need it to be diverse you don't want to uh just have a lot of correct examples of one thing you need to really cover the space of possibility as much as you can and the more you can cover the space of possible inputs the better the algorithm will work at the end now once you have really good data sets that you're collecting curating um and cleaning you can train uh your neural net um on top of that so a lot of the work goes into cleaning those data sets now as you pointed out it's probably it could be the question is how do you achieve a ton of uh if you want to basically predict in 3D you need data in 3D to back that up so in this video we have eight videos coming from all the cameras of the system and this is what they saw and this is the truth of what actually was around there was this car there was this car this car these are the lane line markings this is geometry of the road there's a traffic light in this three-dimensional position you need the ground truth um and so the big question that the team was solving of course is how do you how do you arrive at that ground truth because once you have a million of it and it's large clean and diverse then training a neural network on it works extremely well and you can ship that into the car and uh so there's many mechanisms by which we collected that training data you can always go for human annotation you can go for simulation as a source of ground truth you can also go for what we call the offline tracker um that we've spoken about at the AI day and so on which is basically an automatic reconstruction process for taking those videos and recovering the three-dimensional sort of reality of what was around that car so basically think of doing like a three-dimensional reconstruction as an offline thing and then understanding that okay there's 10 seconds of video this is what we saw and therefore here's all the lane last cars and so on and then once you have that annotation you can train your neural Nets to imitate it and how difficult is the reconstruct the 3D reconstruction it's difficult but it can be done so there's so the there's overlap between the cameras and you do the Reconstruction and there's uh perhaps if there's any inaccuracy so that's caught in The annotation step uh yes the nice thing about The annotation is that it is fully offline you have infinite time you have a chunk of one minute and you're trying to just offline in a super computer somewhere figure out where were the positions of all the cars all the people and you have your full one minute of video from all the Angles and you can run all the neural Nets you want and they can be very efficient massive neural Nets there can be neural Nets that can't even run in the car later at this time so they can be even more powerful neurons than what you can eventually deploy so you can do anything you want three-dimensional reconstruction neural Nets uh anything you want just to recover that truth and then you supervise that truth what have you learned you said no mistakes about humans doing annotation because I assume humans are uh there's like a range of things they're good at in terms of clicking stuff on screen it's not how interesting is that to you of a problem of designing an annotator where humans are accurate enjoy it like what are they even the metrics are efficient or productive all that kind of stuff yeah so uh I grew The annotation team at Tesla from basically zero to a thousand uh while I was there that was really interesting you know my background is a PhD student researcher so growing that common organization was pretty crazy uh but uh yeah I think it's extremely interesting and part of the design process very much behind the autopilot as to where you use humans humans are very good at certain kinds of annotations they're very good for example at two-dimensional annotations of images they're not good at annotating uh cars over time in three-dimensional space very very hard and so that's why we were very careful to design the tasks that are easy to do for humans versus things that should be left to the offline tracker like maybe the maybe the computer will do all the triangulation and 3D reconstruction but the human will say exactly these pixels of the image are car exactly these pixels are human and so co-designing the the data annotation pipeline was very much bread and butter was what I was doing daily do you think there's still a lot of open problems in that space um just in general annotation where the stuff the machines are good at machines do and the humans do what they're good at and there's maybe some iterative process right I think to a very large extent we went through a number of iterations and we learned a ton about how to create these data sets I'm not seeing big open problems like originally when I joined I was like I was really not sure how this would turn out yeah but by the time I left I was much more secure in actually we sort of understand the philosophy of how to create these data sets and I was pretty comfortable with where that was at the time so what are strengths and limitations of cameras for the driving test in your understanding when you formulate the driving task as a vision task with eight cameras you've seen that the entire you know most of the history of the computer vision field when it has to do with neural networks what just if you step back what are the strengths and limitations of pixels of using pixels to drive yeah pixels I think are a beautiful sensory beautiful sensor I would say the thing is like cameras are very very cheap and they provide a ton of information ton of bits uh so it's uh extremely cheap sensor for a ton of bits and each one of these bits as a constraint on the state of the world and so you get lots of megapixel images uh very cheap and it just gives you all these constraints for understanding what's actually out there in the world so vision is probably the highest bandwidth sensor it's a very high bandwidth sensor and um I love that pixels it is a is a constraint on the world This is highly complex uh high bandwidth constraint in the world on the stage of the world that's fascinating it's not just that but again this real real importance of it's the sensor that humans use therefore everything is designed for that sensor yeah the text the writing the flashing signs everything is designed for vision and so and you just find it everywhere and so that's why that is the interface you want to be in um talking again about these Universal interfaces and uh that's where we actually want to measure the world as well and then develop software uh for that sensor but there's other constraints on the state of the world that humans use to understand the world I mean Vision ultimately is the main one but we're like we're like referencing our understanding of human behavior and some common sense physics that could be inferred from vision from from a perception perspective but it feels like we're using some kind of reasoning to predict the world yeah not just the pixels I mean you have a powerful prior uh sorry right for how the world evolves over time Etc so it's not just about the likelihood term coming up from the data itself telling you about what you are observing but also the prior term of like where where are the likely things to see and how do they likely move and so on and the question is how complex is the uh the the range of possibilities that might happen in the driving task right that's still is is that to you still an open problem of how difficult is driving like philosophically speaking like do you all the time you've worked on driving do you understand how hard driving is yeah driving is really hard because it has to do with the predictions of all these other agents and the theory of mind and you know what they're gonna do and are they looking at you are they where are they looking what are they thinking yeah there's a lot that goes there at the at the full tail of you know the the expansion of the nines that we have to be comfortable with eventually the final problems are of that form I don't think those are the problems that are very common uh I think eventually they're important but it's like really in the tail end in the tail and the rare edge cases from the vision perspective what are the toughest parts of the vision problem of driving um well basically the sensor is extremely powerful but you still need to process that information um and so going from brightnesses of these pixel values to hey here the three-dimensional world is extremely hard and that's what the neural networks are fundamentally doing and so um the difficulty really is in just doing an extremely good job of engineering the entire pipeline uh the entire data engine having the capacity to train these neural nuts having the ability to evaluate the system and iterate on it uh so I would say just doing this in production at scale is like the hard part it's an execution problem so the data engine but also the um the sort of deployment of the system such that has low latency performance so it has to do all these steps yeah for the neural net specifically just making sure everything fits into the chip on the car yeah and uh you have a finite budget of flops that you can perform and uh and memory bandwidth and other constraints and you have to make sure it flies and you can squeeze in as much compute as you can into the tiny what have you learned from that process because it maybe that's one of the bigger like new things coming from a research background where there's there's a system that has to run under heavily constrained resources right has to run really fast what what kind of insights have you uh learned from that yeah I'm not sure if it's if there's too many insights you're trying to create a neural net that will fit in what you have available and you're always trying to optimize it and we talked a lot about it on the AI day and uh basically the the triple backflips that the team is doing to make sure it all fits and utilizes the engine uh so I think it's extremely good engineering um and then there's also all kinds of little insights peppered in on how to do it properly let's actually zoom out because I don't think we talked about the data engine the entirety of the layout of this idea that I think is just beautiful with humans in the loop can you describe the data engine yeah the data engine is what I call the almost biological feeling like process by which you uh perfect the training sets for these neural networks um so because most of the programming now is in the level of these data sets and make sure they're large diverse and clean oh basically you have a data set that you think is good you train your neural net you deploy it and then you observe how well it's performing and you're trying to uh always increase the quality of your data set so you're trying to catch scenarios basically there are basically rare and uh it is in these scenarios that the neural Nets will typically struggle in because they weren't told what to do in those rare cases in the data set but now you can close the loop because if you can now collect all those at scale you can then feed them back into the Reconstruction process I described and uh reconstruct the truth in those cases and add it to the data set and so the whole thing ends up being like a staircase of improvement of perfecting your training set and you have to go through deployments so that you can mine uh the parts that are not yet represented well in the data set so your data set is basically imperfect it needs to be diverse it has pockets there are missing and you need to pad out the pockets you can sort of think of it that way in the data what role do humans play in this so what's the uh this biological system like a human body is made up of cells what what role like how do you optimize the human uh system the the multiple Engineers collaborating figuring out what to focus on what to contribute which which task to optimize in this neural network uh who's in charge of figuring out which task needs more data can you speak to the hyper parameters the human uh system right it really just comes down to extremely good execution from an engineering team and does what they're doing they understand intuitively the philosophical insights underlying the data engine and the process by which the system improves and uh how to again like delegate the strategy of the data collection and how that works and then just making sure it's all extremely well executed and that's where most of the work is is not even the philosophizing or the research or the ideas of it it's just extremely good execution it's so hard when you're dealing with data at that scale so your role in the data engine executing well on it it is difficult and extremely important is there a priority of like uh like a vision board of saying like we really need to get better at stop lights yeah like the the prioritization of tasks is that essentially and that comes from the data that comes to um a very large extent to what we are trying to achieve in the product for a map where we're trying to the release we're trying to get out um in the feedback from the QA team worth it where the system is struggling or not the things we're trying to improve and the QA team gives some signal some information in aggregate about the performance of the system in various conditions and then of course all of us drive it and we can also see it it's really nice to work with the system that you can also experience yourself you know it drives you home it's is there some insight you can draw from your individual experience that you just can't quite get from an aggregate statistical analysis of data yeah it's so weird right yes it's it's not scientific in a sense because you're just one anecdotal sample yeah I think there's a ton of uh it's a source of truth it's your interaction with the system yeah and you can see it you can play with it you can perturb it you can get a sense of it you have an intuition for it I think numbers just like have a way of numbers and plots and graphs are you know much harder yeah it hides a lot of it's like if you train a language model it's a really powerful way is by you interacting with it yeah 100 try to build up an intuition yeah I think like Elon also like he always wanted to drive the system himself he drives a lot and uh I'm gonna say almost daily so uh he also sees this as a source of Truth you driving the system uh and it performing and yeah so what do you think tough questions here uh so Tesla last year removed radar from um from the sensor suite and now just announced that it's going to remove all ultrasonic sensors relying solely on Vision so camera only does that make the perception problem harder or easier I would almost reframe the question in some way so the thing is basically you would think that additional sensors by the way can I just interrupt good I wonder if a language model will ever do that if you prompt it let me reframe your question that would be epic this is the wrong problem sorry it's like a little bit of a wrong question because basically you would think that these sensors are an asset to you yeah but if you fully consider the entire product in its entirety these sensors are actually potentially reliability because these sensors aren't free they don't just appear on your car you need something you need to have an entire supply chain you have people procuring it there can be problems with them they may need replacement they are part of the manufacturing process they can hold back the line in production you need to Source them you need to maintain them you have to have teams that write the firmware all of it and then you also have to incorporate and fuse them into the system in some way and so it actually like bloats the organ the a lot of it and I think Elon is really good at simplify simplified best part is no part and he always tries to throw away things that are not essential because he understands the entropy in organizations and approach and I think uh in this case the cost is high and you're not potentially seeing it if you're just a computer vision engineer and I'm just trying to improve my network and you know is it more useful or less useful how useful is it and the thing is if once you consider the full cost of a sensor it actually is potentially a liability and you need to be really sure that it's giving you extremely useful information in this case we looked at using it or not using it and the Delta was not massive and so it's not useful is it also blow in the data engine like having more sensors is a distraction and these sensors you know they can change over time for example you can have one type of say radar you can have other type of radar they change over time I suddenly need to worry about it now suddenly you have a column in your sqlite telling you oh which sensor type was it and they all have different distributions and then uh they can they just they contribute noise and entropy into everything and they bloat stuff and also organizationally has been really fascinating to me that it can be very distracting um if you if all if you only want to get to work is Vision all the resources are on it and you're building out a data engine and you're actually making forward progress because that is the the sensor with the most bandwidth the most constraints on the world and you're investing fully into that and you can make that extremely good if you're uh you're only a finite amount of sort of spend of focus across different facets of the system and uh this kind of reminds me of Rich Sutton's a bitter lesson it just seems like simplifying the system yeah in the long run now of course you don't know what the long run it seems to be always the right solution yeah yes in that case it was 4rl but it seems to apply generally across all systems that do computation yeah so where uh what do you think about the lidar as a crutch debate uh the battle between point clouds and pixels yeah I think this debate is always like slightly confusing to me because it seems like the actual debate should be about like do you have the fleet or not that's like the really important thing about whether you can achieve a really good functioning of an AI system at this scale so data collection systems yeah do you have a fleet or not it's significantly more important whether you have lidar or not it's just another sensor um and uh yeah I think similar to the radar discussion basically I um but yeah I don't think it it um basically doesn't offer extra extra information is extremely costly it has all kinds of problems you have to worry about it you have to calibrate it Etc it creates bloat and entropy you have to be really sure that you need this uh this um sensor in this case I basically don't think you need it and I think honestly I will make a stronger statement I think the others some of the other uh companies are using it are probably going to drop it yeah so you have to consider the sensor in the full in considering can you build a big Fleet that collects a lot of data and can you integrate that sensor with that that data and that sensor into a data engine that's able to quickly find different parts of the data that then continuously improves whatever the model that you're using yeah another way to look at it is like vision is necessary in a sense that uh the drive the world is designed for human visual consumption so you need vision is necessary and then also it is sufficient because it has all the information that you that you need for driving and humans obviously is a vision to drive so it's both necessary and sufficient so you want to focus resources and you have to be really sure if you're going to bring in other sensors you could you could you could add sensors to Infinity at some point you need to draw the line and I think in this case you have to really consider the full cost of any One sensor that you're adopting and do you really need it and I think the answer in this case is no so what do you think about the idea of the that the other companies are forming high resolution maps and constraining heavily the geographic regions in which they operate is that approach not in your in your view um not going to scale over time to the entirety of the United States I think I'll take two as you mentioned like they pre-map all the environments and they need to refresh the map and they have a perfect centimeter level accuracy map of everywhere they're going to drive it's crazy how are you going to when we're talking about autonomy actually changing the world we're talking about the deployment on a on a global scale of autonomous systems for transportation and if you need to maintain a centimeter accurate map for Earth or like for many cities and keep them updated it's a huge dependency that you're taking on huge dependency it's a massive massive dependency and now you need to ask yourself do you really need it and humans don't need it um right so it's it's very useful to have a low-level map of like okay the connectivity of your road you know that there's a fork coming up when you drive an environment you sort of have that high level understanding it's like a small Google Map and Tesla uses Google Map like similar kind of resolution information in the system but it will not pre-map environments to send me a level accuracy it's a crutch it's a distraction it costs entropy and it diffuses the team it dilutes the team and you're not focusing on what's actually necessary which is the computer vision problem what did you learn about machine learning about engineering about life about yourself as one human being from working with Elon Musk I think the most I've learned is about how to sort of run organizations efficiently and how to create efficient organizations and how to fight entropy in an organization so human Engineering in the fight against entropy yeah there's a there's a I think Elon is a very efficient warrior in the fight against entropy in organizations what is the entropy in an organization look like exactly it's process it's it's process and inefficiencies and that kind of stuff yeah meetings he hates meetings he keeps telling people to skip meetings if they're not useful um he basically runs the world's biggest uh startups I would say uh Tesla SpaceX are the world's biggest startups Tesla actually has multiple startups I think it's better to look at it that way and so I think he's he's extremely good at uh at that and uh yeah he's a very good intuition for streamline processes making everything efficient uh best part is no part uh simplifying focusing um and just kind of removing barriers uh moving very quickly making big moves all this is a very startupy sort of seeming things but at scale so strong drive to simplify for me from your perspective I mean that um that also probably applies to just designing systems and machine learning and otherwise yeah like simplify simplify yes what do you think is the secret to maintaining the startup culture in a company that grows is there can you introspect that I do think you need someone in a powerful position with a big hammer like Elon who's like the cheerleader for that idea and ruthless ruthlessly pursues it if no one has a big enough Hammer everything turns into committees democracy within the company uh process talking to stakeholders decision making just everything just crumbles yeah if you have a big person who's also really smart and has a big hammer things move quickly so you said your favorite scene in interstellar is the intense docking scene with the AI and Cooper talking saying uh Cooper what are you doing docking it's not possible no it's necessary such a good line by the way just so many questions there why in AI in that scene presumably is supposed to be able to compute a lot more than the human is saying it's not optimal why the human I mean that's a movie but shouldn't they AI know much better than the human anyway uh what do you think is the value of setting seemingly impossible goals so like uh our initial intuition which seems like something that you have taken on that Elon espouses that where the initial intuition of the community might say this is very difficult and then you take it on anyway with a crazy deadline you're just from a human engineering perspective um uh have you seen the value of that I wouldn't say that setting impossible goals exactly is is a good idea but I think setting very ambitious goals is a good idea I think there's a what I call sublinear scaling of difficulty uh which means that 10x problems are not 10x hard usually 10x 10x harder problem is like 2 or 3x harder to execute on because if you want to actually like if you want to improve the system by 10 it costs some amount of work and if you want to 10x improve the system it doesn't cost you know 100x amount of the work and it's because you fundamentally change the approach and it if you start with that constraint then some approaches are obviously dumb and not going to work and it forces you to reevaluate um and I think it's a very interesting way of approaching problem solving but it requires a weird kind of thinking it's just going back to your like PhD days it's like how do you think which ideas in in the machine Learning Community are solvable yes it's uh it requires what is that I mean there's the cliche of first prince people's thinking but like it requires to basically ignore what the community is saying because doesn't the community doesn't a community in science usually draw lines of what isn't isn't possible right and like it's very hard to break out of that without going crazy yep I mean I think a good example here is you know the Deep learning revolution in some sense because you could be in computer vision at that time when during the Deep learning sort of revolution of 2012 and so on uh you could be improving your computer vision stack by 10 or we can just be saying actually all this is useless and how do I do 10x better computer vision well it's not probably by tuning a hog feature detector I need a different approach um I need something that is scalable going back to uh Richard Sutton's um and understanding sort of like the philosophy of the uh bitter lesson and then being like actually I need a much more scalable system like a neural network that in principle works and then having some deep Believers that can actually execute on that mission and make it work so that's the 10x solution what do you think is the timeline to solve the problem of autonomous driving this still in part an open question yeah I think the tough thing with timelines of self-driving obviously is that no one has created self-driving yeah so it's not like what do you think is a timeline to build this bridge well we've built million Bridges before here's how long that takes it's it you know it's uh no one has built autonomy it's not obvious uh some parts turn out to be much easier than others so it's really hard to forecast you do your best based on trend lines and so on and based on intuition but that's why fundamentally it's just really hard to forecast this no one has even still like being inside of it is hard to uh to do yes some things turn out to be much harder and some things turn out to be much easier do you try to avoid making forecasts because like Elon doesn't avoid them right and heads of car companies in the past have not avoided it either uh Ford and other places have made predictions that we're going to solve at level four driving by 2020 2021 whatever and now they're all kind of Backtrack on that prediction IU as a as an AI person do you free yourself privately make predictions or do they get in the way of like your actual ability to think about a thing yeah I would say like what's easy to say is that this problem is tractable and that's an easy prediction to make extractable it's going to work yes it's just really hard some things turn out to be harder than some things turn out to be easier uh so uh but it definitely feels tractable and it feels like at least the team at Tesla which is what I saw internally is definitely on track to that how do you form a uh strong representation that allows you to make a prediction about tractability so like you're the leader of a lot a lot of humans you have to kind of say this is actually possible like how do you build up that intuition it doesn't have to be even driving it could be other tasks it could be um and I wonder what difficult tasks did you work on in your life I mean classification achieving certain just an image that certain level of superhuman level performance yeah expert intuition it's just intuition it's belief so just like thinking about it long enough like studying looking at sample data like you said driving uh my intuition has really flawed on this like I don't have a good intuition about tractability it could be either it could be anything it could be solvable like uh you know the driving task could could be simplified into something quite trivial like uh the solution to the problem would be quite trivial and at scale more and more cars driving perfectly might make the problem much easier Yeah the more cars you have driving like people learn how to drive correctly not correctly but in a way that's more optimal for a heterogeneous system of autonomous and semi-autonomous and manually driven cars that could change stuff then again also I've spent a ridiculous number of hours just staring at pedestrians crossing streets thinking about humans and it feels like the way we use our eye contact it sends really strong signals and there's certain quirks and edge cases of behavior and of course a lot of the fatalities that happen have to do with drunk driving and um both on The Pedestrian side and the driver's side so there's that problem of driving at night and all that kind of yeah so I wonder you know it's like the space of possible solution to autonomous driving includes so many human factor issues that it's almost impossible to predict there could be super clean nice Solutions yeah I would say definitely like to use a game analogy there's some fog of War but you definitely also see the frontier of improvement and you can measure historically how much you've made progress and I think for example at least what I've seen in uh roughly five years at Tesla when I joined it barely kept laying on the highway I think going up from Palo Alto to SF was like three or four interventions anytime the road would do anything geometrically or turn too much it would just like not work and so going from that to like a pretty competent system in five years and seeing what happens also under the hood and what the scale which the team is operating now with respect to data and compute and everything else uh is just a massive progress so there's a you're climbing a mountain and it's fog but you're making a lot of progress fog you're making progress and you see what the next directions are and you're looking at some of the remaining challenges and they're not like uh they're not perturbing you and they're not changing your philosophy and you're not contorting yourself you're like actually these are the things that we still need to do yeah the fundamental components of solving the problems seem to be there for the data engine to the compute to the the computer on the car to the compute for the training all that kind of stuff so you've done uh over the years you've been a test you've done a lot of amazing uh breakthrough ideas and Engineering all of it um from the data engine to The Human Side all of it can you speak to why you chose to leave Tesla basically as I described that ran I think over time during those five years I've kind of uh gotten myself into a little bit of a managerial position most of my days were you know meetings and growing the organization and making decisions about sort of high level strategic decisions about the team and what it should be working on and so on and uh it's kind of like a corporate executive role and I can do it I think I'm okay at it but it's not like fundamentally what I what I enjoy and so I think uh when I joined uh there was no computer vision team because Tesla was just going from the transition of using mobileye a third-party vendor for all of its computer vision to having to build its computer vision system so when I showed up there were two people training deep neural networks and they were training them at a computer at their at their legs like uh kind of basic classification task yeah and so I kind of like grew that into what I think is a fairly respectable deep learning team a massive compute cluster a very good um data annotation organization and uh I was very happy with where that was it became quite autonomous and so I kind of stepped away and I uh you know I'm very excited to do much more technical things again yeah and kind of like we focus on AGI what was this soul searching like because you took a little time off and think like what um how many mushrooms did you take no I'm just uh I mean what what was going through your mind the human lifetime is finite yeah he did a few incredible things you're you're one of the best teachers of AI in the world you're one of the best and I don't mean that I mean that in the best possible way you're one of the best tinkerers in the AI world meaning like understanding the fundamental fundamentals of how something works by building it from scratch and playing with it with the basic intuitions it's like Einstein feinmen were all really good at this kind of stuff like a small example of a thing to to play with it to try to understand it uh so that and obviously now with us that you help build a team of machine learning um uh like engineers and a system that actually accomplishes something in the real world so given all that like what was the soul searching like well it was hard because obviously I love the company a lot and I love I love Elon I love Tesla I want um it was hard to leave I love the team basically um but yeah I think actually I would potentially like interested in revisiting it maybe coming back at some point uh working in Optimus working in AGI at Tesla uh I think Tesla is going to do incredible things it's basically like uh it's a massive large-scale robotics kind of company with a ton of In-House talent for doing really incredible things and I think uh human robots are going to be amazing I think autonomous transportation is going to be amazing all this is happening at Tesla so I think it's just a really amazing organization so being part of it and helping it along I think was very basically I enjoyed that a lot yeah it was basically difficult for those reasons because I love the company uh but you know I'm happy to potentially at some point come back for act two but I felt like at this stage I built the team it felt autonomous and uh I became a manager and I wanted to do a lot more technical stuff I wanted to learn stuff I wanted to teach stuff and uh I just kind of felt like it was a good time for for a change of pace a little bit what do you think is uh the best movie sequel of all time speaking of part two because like because most of them suck in movie sequels yeah and you tweet about movies so just in a tiny tangent is there what's your what was like a favorite movie sequel Godfather Part Two um are you a fan of Godfather because you didn't even tweet or mention the Godfather yeah I don't love that movie I know it hasn't edit that out we're gonna edit out the hate towards the Godfather how dare you just I think I will make a strong statement I don't know why I don't know why but I basically don't like any movie before 1995 something like that didn't you mention Terminator two okay okay that's like uh Terminator 2 was a little bit later 1990 no I think Terminator 2 was a name I like Terminator one as well so okay so like a few exceptions but by and large for some reason I don't like movies before 1995 or something they feel very slow the camera is like zoomed out it's boring it's kind of naive it's kind of weird and also Terminator was very much ahead of its time yes and The Godfather there's like no AGI [Laughter] I mean but you have Good Will Hunting was one of the movies you mentioned and that doesn't have any AGI either I guess that's mathematics yeah I guess occasionally I do enjoy movies that don't feature or like Anchorman that has no that's the increment it's so good I don't understand um speaking of AGI because I don't understand why Will Ferrell is so funny it doesn't make sense it doesn't compute there's just something about him and he's a singular human because you don't get that many comedies these days and I wonder if it has to do about the culture uh or the like the machine of Hollywood or does it have to do with just we got lucky with certain people and comedy it came together because he is a singular human that was a ridiculous tangent I apologize but you mentioned humanoid robot so what do you think about Optimus about Tesla bot do you think we'll have robots in the factory in in the home in 10 20 30 40 50 years yeah I think it's a very hard project I think it's going to take a while but who else is going to build humano robots at scale yeah and I think it is a very good form factor to go after because like I mentioned the the world is designed for humanoid form factor these things would be able to operate our machines they would be able to sit down in chairs uh potentially even drive cars uh basically the world is designed for humans that's the form factor you want to invest into and make work over time uh I think you know there's another school of thought which is okay pick a problem and design a robot to it but actually designing a robot and getting a whole data engine and everything behind it to work is actually an incredibly hard problem so it makes sense to go after General interfaces that uh okay they are not perfect for any one given task but they actually have the generality of just with a prompt with English able to do something across and so I think it makes a lot of sense to go after a general uh interface um in the physical world and I think it's a very difficult project I think it's going to take time but I see no other no other company that can execute on that Vision I think it's going to be amazing like uh basically physical labor like if you think transportation is a large Market try physical labor insane well but it's not just physical labor to me the thing that's also exciting is the social robotics so the the relationship we'll have on different levels with those robots that's why I was really excited to see Optimus like um people have criticized me for the excitement but I've I've worked with uh uh a lot of research Labs that do humanoid legged robots Boston Dynamics unitary a lot there's a lot of companies that do legged robots but that's the the Elegance of the movement is a tiny tiny part of the big picture so integrating the two big exciting things to me about Tesla doing humanoid or any Lego robots is clearly integrating it into the data engine so the the data engine aspect so the actual intelligence for the perception and the and the control and the planning and all that kind of stuff integrating into this huge the fleet that you mentioned right um and then speaking of Fleet the second thing is the mass manufacturers Just knowing uh culturally uh driving towards a simple robot that's cheap to produce at scale yeah and doing that well having experience to do that well that changes everything that's why that's a very different culture and style than Boston Dynamics who by the way those those robots are just the the way they move it's uh like it'll be a very long time before Tesla could achieve the smoothness of movement but that's not what it's about it's it's about uh it's about the entirety of the system like we talked about the data engine and the fleet that's super exciting even the initial sort of models uh but that too was really surprising that in a few months you can get a prototype yep and the reason that happened very quickly is as you alluded to there's a ton of copy based from what's happening in the autopilot yes a lot the amount of expertise that like came out of the Woodworks at Tesla for building the human robot was incredible to see like basically Elon said at one point we're doing this and then next day basically like all these CAD models started to appear and people talk about like the supply chain and Manufacturing and uh people showed up with like screwdrivers and everything like the other day and started to like put together the body and I was like whoa like all these people exist at Tesla and fundamentally building a car is actually not that different from building a robot the same and that is true uh not just for uh the hardware pieces and also let's not forget Hardware not just for a demo but manufacturing of that Hardware at scale is like a whole different thing but for software as well basically this robot currently thinks it's a car uh it's gonna have a midlife crisis at some point it thinks it's a car um some of the earlier demos actually we were talking about potentially doing them outside in the parking lot because that's where all of the computer vision that was like working out of the box instead of like in inside um but all the operating system everything just copy pastes uh computer vision mostly copy paste I mean you have to retrain the neural Nets but the approach and everything in data engine and offline trackers and the way we go about the occupancy tracker and so on everything copy paste you just need to retrain the neural Lots uh and then the planning control of course has to change quite a bit but there's a ton of copy paste from what's happening at Tesla and so if you were to if you were to go with goal of like okay let's build a million human robots and you're not Tesla that's that's a lot to ask if you're a Tesla it's actually like it's not it's not that crazy and then the the follow-up question is and how difficult just like we're driving how difficult is the manipulation task uh such that it can have an impact at scale I think depending on the context the really nice thing about robotics is the um unless you do a manufacturing that kind of stuff is there's more room for error driving is so safety critical and so that and also time critical robot is allowed to move slower which is nice yes I think it's going to take a long time but the way you want to structure the development is you need to say okay it's going to take a long time how can I set up the uh product development roadmap so that I'm making Revenue along the way I'm not setting myself up for a zero one loss function where it doesn't work until it works you don't want to be in that position you want to make it useful almost immediately and then you want to slowly deploy it uh and uh at scale and you want to set up your data engine your improvement Loops the Telemetry the evaluation the harness and everything and you want to improve the product over time incorrectly and you're making Revenue along the way that's extremely important because otherwise you cannot build these these uh large undertakings just like don't make sense economically and also from the point of view of the team working on it they need the dopamine along the way they're not just going to make a promise about this being useful this is going to change the world in 10 years when it works this is not where you want to be you want to be in a place like I think autopilot is today where it's offering increased safety and um and uh convenience of driving today people pay for it people like it people purchase it and then you also have the greater mission that you're working towards and you see that so the dopamine for the team that that was a source of Happiness yes you're deploying this people like it people drive it people pay for it they care about it there's all these YouTube videos your grandma drives it she gives you feedback people like it people engage with it you engage with it huge do uh people that drive Teslas like recognize you and give you love like uh like hey thanks for the for the this nice feature that it's doing yeah I think the tricky thing is like some people really love you some people unfortunately like you're working on something that you think is extremely valuable useful Etc some people do hate you there's a lot of people who like hate me and the team and whatever the whole project and I think they have Tesla drivers uh many cases they're not actually yeah that's that's actually makes me sad about humans or the current the ways that humans interact I think that's actually fixable I think humans want to be good to each other I think Twitter and social media is part of the mechanism that actually somehow makes the negativity more viral but it doesn't deserve like disproportionately uh add of like a viral viral boost yeah negativity but like I wish people would just get excited about uh so suppress some of the jealousy some of the ego and just get excited for others and then there's a Karma aspect to that you get excited for others they'll get excited for you same thing in Academia if you're not careful there's a like a dynamical system there if you if you think of in silos and get jealous of somebody else being successful that actually perhaps counterintuitively uh leads the less productivity of you as a community and you individually I feel like if you keep celebrating others that actually makes you more successful yeah I think people haven't in depending on the industry haven't quite learned that yet yeah some people are also very negative and very vocal so they're very prominently featured but actually there's a ton of people who are cheerleaders but they're silent cheerlead cheerleaders and uh when you talk to people just in the world they will all tell you it's amazing it's great especially like people who understand how difficult it is to get this stuff working like people who have built products and makers entrepreneur entrepreneurs like make making this work and changing something is is incredibly hard those people are more likely to cheerlead you well one of the things that makes me sad is some folks in the robotics Community uh don't do the cheerleading and they should there's uh because they know how difficult it is well they actually sometimes don't know how difficult it is to create a product at scale right they actually deploy in the real world a lot of the development of robots and AI systems is done on very specific small benchmarks um and as opposed to real world conditions yes yeah I think it's really hard to work on robotics in academic setting or AI systems that apply in the real world you you've criticized you uh flourished and loved for time the imagenet the famed image in that data set and I've recently had some words uh of criticism that the academic research ml Community gives a little too much love still to the imagenet or like those kinds of benchmarks can you speak to the strengths and weaknesses of data sets used in machine learning research actually I don't know that I recall the specific instance where I was uh unhappy or criticizing imagenet I think imagenet has been extremely valuable uh it was basically a benchmark that allowed the Deep Learning Community to demonstrate that deep neural networks actually work it was uh there's a massive value in that um so I think imagenet was useful but um basically it's become a bit of an eminist at this point so eminist is like the 228 by 28 grayscale digits there's kind of a joke data set that everyone like just crushes if there's no Papers written on MNS though right maybe they should have strong papers like papers that focus on like how do we learn with a small amount of data that kind of stuff yeah I could see that being helpful but not in sort of like Mainline computer vision research anymore of course I think the way I've heard you somewhere maybe I'm just imagining things but I think you said like image that was a huge contribution to the community for a long time and now it's time to move past those kinds of well image that has been crushed I mean you know the error rates are uh yeah we're getting like 90 accuracy in in one thousand classification way uh prediction and I've seen those images and it's like really high that's really that's really good if I remember correctly the top five error rate is now like one percent or something given your experience with a gigantic real world data set would you like to see benchmarks move in certain directions that the research Community uses unfortunately I don't think academics currently have the next imagenet uh We've obviously I think we've crushed mnist we've basically kind of crushed imagenet uh and there's no next sort of big Benchmark that the entire Community rallies behind and uses um you know for further development of these networks uh yeah what it takes for data set to Captivate the imagination of everybody like where they all get behind it that that could also need like a viral like a leader right you know somebody with popularity I mean that yeah why did image of that take off is there or is it just the accident of History it was the right amount of difficult uh it was the right amount of difficult and simple and uh interesting enough it just kind of like it was it was the right time for that kind of a data set question from Reddit uh what are your thoughts on the role that synthetic data and game engines will play in the future of neural net model development I think um as neural Nets converge to humans uh the value of simulation to neural Nets will be similar to value of simulation to humans so people use simulation for uh people use simulation because they can learn something in that kind of a system and without having to actually experience it um but are you referring to the simulation we're doing our head no sorry simulation I mean like video games or uh you know other forms of simulation for various professionals well so let me push back on that because maybe their simulation that we do in our heads like simulate if I do this what do I think will happen Okay that's like internal simulation yeah internal isn't that what we're doing let's assuming before we act oh yeah but that's independent from like the use of uh simulation in the sense of like computer games or using simulation for training set creation or you know is it independent or is it just Loosely correlated because like uh isn't that useful to do like um counterfactual or like Edge case simulation to like you know what happens if there's a nuclear war what happens if there's you know like those kinds of things yeah that's a different simulation from like Unreal Engine that's how I interpreted the question uh so like simulation of the average case is that what's Unreal Engine what what what what what do you mean by Unreal Engine so simulating a world yeah physics of that world why is that different like because you also can add Behavior to that world and you can try all kinds of stuff right like you could throw all kinds of weird things into it so Unreal Engine is not just about similar I mean I guess it is about submitting the physics of the world it's also doing something with that yeah the graphics the physics and the Agents that you put into the environment and stuff like that yeah see I think you I feel like you said that it's not that important I guess for the future of AI development is that is that correct to interpret you that way uh I think humans use uh simulators for um humans use simulators and they find them useful and so computers will use simulators and find them useful okay so you're saying it's not I I don't use simulators very often I play a video game every once in a while but I don't think I derive any wisdom about my own existence from from those video games it's a momentary escape from reality versus a source of wisdom about reality so I don't so I think that's a very polite way of saying simulation is not that useful yeah maybe maybe not I don't see it as like a fundamental really important part of like training neural Nets currently uh but I think uh as neural Nets become more and more powerful I think you will need fewer examples to train additional behaviors and uh simulation is of course there's a domain Gap in a simulation that's not the real world there's slightly something different but uh with a powerful enough neural net uh you need um The Domain Gap can be bigger I think because neural network will sort of understand that even though it's not the real world it like has all this high level structure that I'm supposed to be able to learn from so then you'll know we'll actually yeah you'll be able to Leverage the synthetic data better yes by closing the get better understanding in which ways this is not real data exactly uh right to do better questions next time that was that was a question but I'm just kidding all right um so is it possible do you think speaking of feminist to construct neural Nets and training processes that require very little data so we've been talking about huge data sets like the internet for training I mean one way to say that is like you said like the querying itself is another level of training I guess and that requires a little data yeah but do you see any uh value in doing research and kind of going down the direction of can we use very little data to train to construct a knowledge base 100 I just think like at some point you need a massive data set and then when you pre-train your massive neural nut and get something that you know is like a GPT or something then you're able to be very efficient at training any arbitrary new task uh so a lot of these gpts you know you can do tasks like sentiment analysis or translation or so on just by being prompted with very few examples here's the kind of thing I want you to do like here's an input sentence here's the translation into German input sentence translation to German input sentence blank and the neural network will complete the translation to German just by looking at sort of the example you've provided and so that's an example of a very few shot uh learning in the activations of the neural net instead of the weights of the neural land and so I think basically uh just like humans neural Nets will become very data efficient at learning any other new task but at some point you need a massive data set to pre-train your network to get that and probably we humans have something like that do we do we have something like that do we have a passive in the background background model constructing thing that just runs all the time in a self-supervised way we're not conscious of it I think humans definitely I mean obviously we have uh we learn a lot during during our life span but also we have a ton of Hardware that helps us initialize initialization coming from sort of evolution and so I think that's also a really big a big component a lot of people in the field I think they just talk about the amounts of like seconds and the you know that a person has lived pretending that this is a table arasa sort of like a zero initialization of a neural net and it's not like you can look at a lot of animals like for example zebras zebras get born and they see and they can run there's zero train data in their lifespan they can just do that so somehow I have no idea how Evolution has found a way to encode these algorithms and these neural net initializations are extremely good to 80 CGS and I have no idea how this works but apparently it's possible because here's a proof by existence there's something magical about going from a single cell to an organism that is born to the first few years of life I kind of like the idea that the reason we don't remember anything about the first few years of our life is that it's a really painful process like it's a very difficult challenging training process yeah like intellectually like and maybe yeah I mean I don't why don't we remember any of that there might be some crazy training going on and the that maybe that's the background model training that uh is is very painful and so it's best for the system once it's trained not to remember how it's constructed I think it's just like the hardware for long-term memory is just not fully developed sure I kind of feel like the first few years of uh of infants is not actually like learning it's brain maturing yeah um we're born premature um and there's a theory along those lines because of the birth canal and the swelling of the brain and so we're born premature and then the first few years we're just the brains maturing and then there's some learning eventually um it's my current view on it what do you think do you think neural Nets can have long-term memory like that approach is something like humans do you think you know do you think there needs to be another meta architecture on top of it to add something like a knowledge base that learns facts about the world and all that kind of stuff yes but I don't know to what extent it will be explicitly constructed um it might take unintuitive forms where you are telling the GPT like hey you have a you have a declarative memory bank to which you can store and retrieve data from and whenever you encounter some information that you find useful just save it to your memory bank and here's an example of something you have retrieved and Heiser how you say it and here's how you load from it you just say load whatever you teach it in text in English and then it might learn to use a memory bank from from that oh so so the neural net is the architecture for the background model the the base thing and then yeah everything else is just on top of this it's not just a text right it's you're giving it gadgets and gizmos so uh you're teaching in some kind of a special Language by which we can it can save arbitrary information and retrieve it at a later time and you're telling about these special tokens and how to arrange them to use these interfaces it's like hey you can use a calculator here's how you use it just do five three plus four one equals and when equals is there uh a calculator will actually read out the answer and you don't have to calculate it yourself and you just like tell it in English this might actually work do you think in that sense gato is interesting the the Deep Mind system that it's not just new language but actually throws it all uh in the same pile images actions all that kind of stuff that's basically what we're moving towards yeah I think so so gato is uh is very much a kitchen sink approach to like um reinforcement learning lots of different environments with a single fixed Transformer model right um I think it's a very sort of early result in that in that realm but I think uh yeah it's along the lines of what I think things will eventually look like right so this is the early days of a system that eventually will look like this like from a rigid Rich sudden perspective yeah I'm not super huge fan of I think all these interfaces that like look very different um I would want everything to be normalized into the same API so for example it's green pixels versus same API instead of having like different world environments at a very different physics and Joint configurations and appearances and whatever and you're having some kind of special tokens for different games that you can plug I'd rather just normalize everything to a single interface so it looks the same to the neural net if that makes sense so it's all going to be pixel based pong in the end I think so okay uh let me ask you about your own personal life a lot of people want to know you're one of the most productive and brilliant people in the history of AI what is a productive day in the life of Andre capathi look like what time do you wake up because imagine um some kind of dance between the average productive day and a perfect productive day so the perfect productive day is the thing we strive towards in the average is kind of what it kind of converges to getting all the mistakes and human eventualities and so on yeah so what times you wake up are you morning person I'm not a morning person I'm a night owl for sure I think stable or not that's semi-stable like a eight or nine or something like that during my PhD it was even later I used to go to sleep usually at 3am I think uh the am hours are are precious and very interesting time to work because everyone is asleep um at 8 AM or 7 A.M the east coast is awake so there's already activity there's already some text messages whatever there's stuff happening you can go in like some news website and there's stuff happening it's distracting uh at 3am everything is totally quiet and so you're not going to be bothered and you have solid chunks of time to do your work um so I like those periods Night Owl by default and then I think like productive time basically um what I like to do is you need you need to like build some momentum on the problem without too much distraction and um you need to load your Ram uh your working memory with that problem and then you need to be obsessed with it when you're taking shower when you're falling asleep you need to be obsessed with the problem and it's fully in your memory and you're ready to wake up and work on it right there so there's a scale of uh is this in a scale temporal scale of a single day or a couple of days a week a month so I can't talk about one day basically in isolation because it's a whole process when I want to get when I want to get productive in the problem I feel like I need a span of a few days where I can really get in on that problem and I don't want to be interrupted and I'm going to just uh be completely obsessed with that problem and that's where I do most of my good workouts you've done a bunch of cool like little projects in a very short amount of time very quickly so that that requires you just focusing on it yeah basically I need to load my working memory with the problem and I need to be productive because there's always like a huge fixed cost to approaching any problem uh you know like I was struggling with this for example at Tesla because I want to work on like small side projects but okay you first need to figure out okay I need to SSH into my cluster I need to bring up a vs code editor so I can like work on this I need to I run into some stupid error because of some reason like you're not at a point where you can be just productive right away you are facing barriers and so it's about uh really removing all that barrier and you're able to go into the problem and you have the full problem loaded in your memory and somehow avoiding distractions of all different forms like uh news stories emails but also distractions from other interesting projects that you previously worked on are currently working on and so on you just want to really focus your mind and I mean I can take some time off for distractions and in between but I think it can't be too much uh you know most of your day is sort of like spent on that problem and then you know I drink coffee I have my morning routine I look at some news uh Twitter Hacker News Wall Street Journal Etc so basically you wake up you have some coffee are you trying to get to work as quickly as possible do you do taking this diet of of like what the hell's happening in the world first I am I do find it interesting to know about the world I don't know that it's useful or good but it is part of my routine right now so I do read through a bunch of news articles and I want to be informed and um I'm suspicious of it I'm suspicious of the practice but currently that's where I am Oh you mean suspicious about the positive effect yeah of that practice on your productivity and your well-being my well-being psychologically uh and also on your ability to deeply understand the world because how there's a bunch of sources of information you're not really focused on deeply integrating yeah it's a little bit distracting or yeah in terms of a perfectly productive day for how long of a stretch of time in one session do you try to work and focus on a thing it's a couple hours is it one hours or 30 minutes is 10 minutes I can probably go like a small few hours and then I need some breaks in between for like food and stuff and uh yeah but I think like uh it's still really hard to accumulate hours I was using a Tracker that told me exactly how much time I've spent coding any one day and even on a very productive day I still spent only like six or eight hours yeah and it's just because there's so much padding commute talking to people food Etc there's like the cost of life just living and sustaining and homeostasis and just maintaining yourself as a human is very high and and there seems to be a desire within the human mind to to uh to participate in society that creates that padding yeah because I yeah the most productive days I've ever had is just completely from start to finish just tuning out everything yep and just sitting there and then and then you could do more than six and eight hours yeah is there some wisdom about what gives you strength to do like uh tough days of long Focus yeah just like whenever I get obsessed about a problem something just needs to work something just needs to exist it needs to exist and you so you're able to deal with bugs and programming issues and technical issues and uh design decisions that turn out to be the wrong ones you're able to think through all of that given given that you want to think to exist yeah it needs to exist and then I think to me also a big factor is uh you know are other humans are going to appreciate it are they going to like it that's a big part of my motivation if I'm helping humans and they seem happy they say nice things uh they tweet about it or whatever that gives me pleasure because I'm doing something useful so like you do see yourself sharing it with the world like with yes on GitHub with a blog post or through videos yeah I was thinking about it like suppose I did all these things but did not share them I don't think I would have the same amount of motivation that I can build up you enjoy the feeling of other people uh gaining value and happiness from the stuff you've created yeah uh what about diet is there I saw you playing with in intermittent fast do you fast does that help with everything well the things you played what's been most beneficial to the your ability to mentally focus on a thing and just meant the mental productivity and happiness you still fast yeah it's so fast but I do intermittent fasting but really what it means at the end of the day is I skip breakfast yeah so I do uh 18 6 roughly by default when I'm in my steady state if I'm traveling or doing something else I will break the rules but in my steady state I do 18 6 so I eat only from 12 to 6. not a hard Rule and I break it often but that's my default and then um yeah I've done a bunch of random experiments for the most part right now uh where I've been for the last year and a half I want to say is I'm um plant-based or planned forward I heard plant forward it sounds better exactly I didn't actually know the differences but it sounds better in my mind but it just means I prefer plant-based food and raw or cooked or I prefer cooked uh and blunt paste so plant-based oh forgive me I don't actually know how wide the category of plant entails Wellness just means that you're not uh and you can flex and uh you just prefer to eat plants and you know you're not making you're not trying to influence other people and if someone is you come to someone's house party and they serve you a stake that they're really proud of you will eat it yes right it's just not judgment oh that's beautiful I mean that's um on the flip side of that but I'm very sort of flexible have you tried doing one meal a day uh I have uh accidentally not consistently but I've accidentally had that I don't I don't like it I think it makes me feel uh not good it's too it's too much too much of a hit yeah and uh So currently I have about two meals a day 12 and six I do that non-stop I'm doing it now I'm doing one meal a day okay so it's interesting it's a interesting feeling have you ever fasted longer than a day yeah I've done a bunch of water fasts because I was curious what happens uh anything interesting yeah I would say so I mean you know what's interesting is that you're hungry for two days and then starting day three or so you're not hungry it's like such a weird feeling because you haven't eaten in a few days and you're not hungry isn't that weird it's really one of the many weird things about human biology is figure something out it finds finds another source of energy or something like that or uh relaxes the system I don't know how yeah the body is like you're hungry you're hungry and then it just gives up it's like okay I guess we're fasting now there's nothing and then it just kind of like focuses on trying to make you not hungry uh and you know not feel the the damage of that and uh trying to give you some space to figure out the food situation so are you still to this day most productive uh at night I would say I am but it is really hard to maintain my PhD schedule um especially when I was say working at Tesla and so on it's a non-starter so but even now like you know people want to meet for various events they Society lives in a certain period of time and you sort of have to like work so that's it's hard to like do a social thing and then after that return and do work yeah it's just really hard uh that's why I try to do social things I try not to do too uh too much drinking so I can return and continue doing work um but a Tesla is there is there conversions in Tesla but any any company is there a convergence towards the schedule or is there more is that how humans behave when they collaborate I need to learn about this yeah do they try to keep a consistent schedule you're all awake at the same time I mean I do try to create a routine and I try to create a steady state in which I'm uh comfortable in uh so I have a morning routine I have a day routine I try to keep things to do a steady state and um things are predictable and then you can sort of just like your body just sort of like sticks to that and if you try to stress that a little too much it will create uh you know when you're traveling and you're dealing with jet lag you're not able to really Ascend to you know where you need to go yeah yeah that's weird as humans with the habits and stuff uh what are your thoughts on work-life balance throughout a human lifetime so the testing part was known for sort of pushing people to their limits in terms of what they're able to do in terms of what they're uh trying to do in terms of how much they work all that kind of stuff yeah I mean I will say teslaq is still too much uh bad rep for this because what's happening is Tesla is a it's a bursting environment uh so I would say the Baseline uh my only point of reference is Google where I've interned three times and I saw what it's like inside Google and and deepmind um I would say the Baseline is higher than that but then there's a punctuated equilibrium where once in a while there's a fire and uh someone like people work really hard and so it's spiky and bursty and then all the stories get collected about the bursts yeah and then it gives the appearance of like total insanity but actually it's just a bit more intense environment and there are fires and Sprints and so I think uh you know definitely though I I would say um it's a more intense environment than something you would get but you in your person forget all of that just in your own personal life um what do you think about the happiness of a human being a brilliant person like yourself about finding a balance between work and life or is it such a thing not a good thought experiment yeah I think I think balance is good but I also love to have Sprints that are out of distribution and that's what I think I've been pretty uh creative and um as well Sprints out of distribution means that most of the time you have a yeah quote-unquote balance I have balance most of the time yes I like being obsessed with something once in a while once in a while is what once a week once a month once a year yeah probably like say once a month or something yeah and that's when we get a new GitHub repo come on yeah that's when you like really care about a problem it must exist this will be awesome you're obsessed with it and now you can't just do it on that day you need to pay the fixed cost of getting into the groove and then you need to stay there for a while and then Society will come and they will try to mess with you and they will try to distract you yeah yeah the worst thing is like a person who's like I just need five minutes of your time yeah this is the cost of that is not five minutes and Society needs to change how it thinks about just five minutes of your time right it's never it's never just one minute it's just 30 it's just a quick what's the big deal why are you being so yeah no uh what's your computer setup what uh what's like the perfect are you somebody that's flexible to no matter what laptop four screens yeah uh or do you uh prefer a certain setup that you're most productive um I guess the one that I'm familiar with is one large screen uh 27 inch um and my laptop on the side with operating system I do Max that's my primary for all tasks I would say OS X but when you're working on deep learning everything as Linux your SSH into a cluster and you're working remotely but what about the actual development like that using the IDE yeah you would use uh I think a good way is you just run vs code um my favorite editor right now on your Mac but you are actually you have a remote folder through SSH um so the actual files that you're manipulating are on the cluster somewhere else so what's the best IDE uh vs code what else do people so I use emacs still that's cool uh so it may be cool I don't know if it's maximum productivity um so what what do you recommend in terms of editors you worked with a lot of software Engineers editors for python C plus plus machine learning applications I think the current answer is vs code currently I believe that's the best um IDE it's got a huge amount of extensions it has a GitHub co-pilot um uh integration which I think is very valuable what do you think about the the co-pilot integration I was actually uh I got to talk a bunch with Guido and Rossum who's a creative Python and he loves Coppola he like he programs a lot with it yeah uh do you yeah he's copilot I love it and uh it's free for me but I would pay for it yeah I think it's very good and the utility that I found with it was is in is it I would say there is a learning curve and you need to figure out when it's helpful and when to pay attention to its outputs and when it's not going to be helpful where you should not pay attention to it because if you're just reading its suggestions all the time it's not a good way of interacting with it but I think I was able to sort of like mold myself to it I find it's very helpful number one in copy paste and replace some parts so I don't um when the pattern is clear it's really good at completing the pattern and number two sometimes it suggests apis that I'm not aware of so it tells you about something that you didn't know so and that's an opportunity to discover and you it's an opportunity to see I would never take copilot code AS given I almost always uh copy a copy this into a Google Search and you see what this function is doing and then you're like oh it's actually actually exactly what I need thank you copilot so you learned something so it's in part a search engine apart maybe getting the exact syntax correctly that once you see it yep it's that NP hard thing it's like once you see it you know yes exactly correct exactly you yourself you can struggle you can verify efficiently but you you can't generate efficiently and copilot really I mean it's it's autopilot for programming right and currently it's doing the link following which is like the simple copy paste and sometimes suggest uh but over time it's going to become more and more autonomous and so the same thing will play out in not just coding but actually across many many different things probably but coding is an important one right like writing programs yeah what how do you see the future of that developing uh the program synthesis like being able to write programs that are more and more complicated because right now it's human supervised in interesting ways yes like what it feels like the transition will be very painful my mental model for it is the same thing will happen as with the autopilot uh So currently it's doing link following is doing some simple stuff and eventually we'll be doing autonomy and people will have to intervene less and less and there could be like you like testing mechanisms like if it writes a function and that function looks pretty damn correct but how do you know it's correct because you're like getting lazier and lazier as a programmer like your ability to because like little bugs but I guess it won't make a little no it will it copilot will make uh off by one subtle bugs it has done that to me but do you think future systems will or is it really the off by one is actually a fundamental challenge of programming in that case it wasn't fundamental and I think things can improve but uh yeah I think humans have to supervise I am nervous about people not supervising what comes out and what happens to for example the proliferation of bugs in all of our systems I'm nervous about that but I think and there will probably be some other copilots for bug finding and stuff like that at some point because there will be like a lot more automation for uh oh man so it's like a program a co-pilot that generates a compiler for one that does a linter yes one that does like a a type Checker yes it's a committee of like a GPT sort of like and then they'll be like a manager for the committee yeah and then there'll be somebody that says a new version of this is needed we need to regenerate it yeah there were 10 gpts that were forwarded and gave 50 suggestions another one looked at it and picked a few that they like a bug one looked at it and it was like it's probably a bug they got re-ranked by some other thing and then a final Ensemble uh GPT comes in it's like okay given everything you guys have told me this is probably the next token you know the feeling is the number of programmers in the world has been growing and growing very quickly do you think it's possible that it'll actually level out and drop to like a very low number with this kind of world because then you'll be doing software 2.0 programming um and you'll be doing this kind of generation of copilot type systems programming but you won't be doing the old school software 1.0 program I don't currently think that they're just going to replace human programmers um it's I'm so hesitant saying stuff like this right because this is going to be replaced in five years I don't know it's going to show that like this is where we thought because I I agree with you but I think we might be very surprised right like what are the next I I what's your sense of what we're seeing with language models like does it feel like the beginning or the middle or the end the beginning 100 I think the big question in my mind is for sure GPT will be able to program quite well competently and so on how do you steer the system you still have to provide some guidance to what you actually are looking for and so how do you steer it and how do you say how do you talk to it how do you um audit it and verify that what is done is correct and how do you like work with this and it's as much not just an AI problem but a UI ux problem yeah um so beautiful fertile ground for so much interesting work for vs code plus plus where you're not just it's not just human programming anymore it's amazing yeah so you're interacting with the system so not just one prompt but it's iterative prompting yeah you're trying to figure out having a conversation with the system yeah that actually I mean to me that's super exciting to have a conversation with the program I'm writing yeah maybe at some point uh you're just conversing with it it's like okay here's what I want to do actually this variable maybe it's not even that low level as variable but you can also Imagine like can you translate this to c plus and back to python yeah that already kind of existence no but just like doing it as part of the program experience like I think I'd like to write this function in C plus plus or or like you just keep changing for different uh different programs because they're different syntax maybe I want to convert this into a functional language and so like you get to become multilingual as a programmer and dance back and forth efficiently yeah I mean I think the UI ux of it though is like still very hard to think through because it's not just about writing code on a page you have an entire developer environment you have a bunch of hardware on it uh you have some environmental variables you have some scripts that are running in the Chrome job like there's a lot going on to like working with computers and how do these uh systems set up environment flags and work across multiple machines and set up screen sessions and automate different processes like how all that works and it's auditable by humans and so on is like massive question at the moment you've built archive sanity what is archive and what is the future of academic research publishing that you would like to see so archive is This pre-print Server so if you have a paper you can submit it for publication to journals or conferences and then wait six months and then maybe get a decision pass or fail or you can just upload it to Archive and then people can tweet about it three minutes later and then everyone sees it everyone reads it and everyone can profit from it uh in their own ways you can cite it and it has an official look to it it feels like a pub like it feels like a publication process yeah it feels different than you if you just put in a blog post oh yeah yeah I mean it's a paper and usually the the bar is higher for something that you would expect on archive as opposed to and something you would see in a blog post well the culture created the bar because you could probably yes host a pretty crappy face for an archive um so what's that make you feel like what's that make you feel about peer review so rigorous peer review by two three experts versus the peer review of the community right as it's written yeah basically I think the community is very well able to peer review things very quickly on Twitter and I think maybe it just has to do something with AI machine learning field specifically though I feel like things are more easily auditable um and the verification is is easier potentially than the verification somewhere else so it's kind of like um you can think of these uh scientific Publications there's like little blockchains where everyone's building on each other's work and setting each other and you sort of have ai which is kind of like this much faster and loose blockchain but then you have and any one individual entry is like very um very cheap to make and then you have other fields where maybe that model doesn't make as much sense um and so I think in AI at least things are pretty easily verifiable and so that's why when people upload papers they're a really good idea and so on people can try it out like the next day and they can be the final Arbiter whether it works or not on their problem and the whole thing just moves significantly faster so I kind of feel like Academia still has a place sorry this like conference Journal process still has a place but it's sort of like an um it lags behind I think and it's a bit more maybe higher quality process but it's not sort of the place where you will discover Cutting Edge work anymore yeah it used to be the case when I was starting my PhD that you go to conferences and journals and you discuss all the latest research now when you go to a conference or Journal like no one discusses anything that's there because it's already like three generations ago irrelevant yes which makes me sad about like deepmind for example where they they still they still publish in nature and these big prestigious I mean there's still value as opposed to The Prestige that comes with these big venues but the the result is that they they'll announce some breakthrough performance and it'll take like a year to actually publish the details I mean and those details in if they were published immediately would Inspire the community to move in certain directions with that yeah it would speed up the rest of the community but I don't know to what extent that's part of their objective function also that's true so it's not just the prestige a little bit of the delay is uh is part yeah they certainly deepmind specifically has been um working in the regime of having a slightly higher quality basically process and latency and uh publishing those papers that way another question from Reddit do you or have you suffered from imposter syndrome being the director of AI Tesla being this person when you're at Stanford where like the world looks at you as the expert in AI to teach teach the world about machine learning when I was leaving Tesla after five years I spent a ton of time in meeting rooms uh and you know I would read papers in the beginning when I joined Tesla I was writing code and then I was writing lesson last code and I was reading code and then I was reading lesson less code and so this is just a natural progression that happens I think and uh definitely I would say near the tail end that's when it sort of like starts to hit you a bit more that you're supposed to be an expert but actually the source of Truth is the code that people are writing the GitHub and the actual the actual code itself and you're not as familiar with that as you used to be and so I would say maybe there's some like insecurity there yeah that's actually pretty profound that a lot of the insecurity has to do with not writing the code in the computer science space like that because that is the truth that that right there code is the source of Truth the papers and everything else it's a high level summary I don't uh yeah just a high level summary but at the end of the day you have to read code it's impossible to translate all that code into actual uh you know paper form uh so when when things come out especially when they have a source code available that's my favorite place to go so like I said you're one of the greatest teachers of machine learning AI ever uh from cs231n to today what advice would you give to beginners interested in getting into machine learning beginners are often focused on like what to do and I think the focus should be more like how much you do so I I'm kind of like believer on a high level in this 10 000 hours kind of concept where you just kind of have to just pick the things where you can spend time and you you care about and you're interested in you literally have to put in 10 000 hours of work um it doesn't even like matter as much like where you put it and your you'll iterate and you'll improve and you'll waste some time I don't know if there's a better way you need to put in 10 000 hours but I think it's actually really nice because I feel like there's some sense of determinism about uh being an expert at a thing if you spend ten thousand hours you can literally pick an arbitrary thing and I think if you spend ten thousand hours of deliberate effort and work you actually will become an expert at it and so I think it's kind of like a nice thought um and so uh basically I would focus more on like are you spending 10 000 hours that's what I focus on so and then thinking about what kind of mechanisms maximize your likelihood of getting to ten thousand dollars exactly which for us silly humans means probably forming a daily habit of like every single day actually doing the thing whatever helps you so I do think to a large extent is a psychological problem for yourself uh one other thing that I help that I think is helpful for the psychology of it is many times people compare themselves to others in the area I think this is very harmful only compare yourself to you from some time ago like say a year ago are you better than you year ago this is the only way to think um and I think this then you can see your progress and it's very motivating that's so interesting that focus on the quantity of ours because I think a lot of people uh in the beginner stage but actually throughout get paralyzed uh by uh the choice like which one do I pick this path or this path yeah like they'll literally get paralyzed by like which ID to use well they're worried yeah they're worried about all these things but the thing is some of the you you will waste time doing something wrong yes you will eventually figure out it's not right you will accumulate scar tissue and next time you'll grow stronger because next time you'll have the scar tissue and next time you'll learn from it and now next time you come into a similar situation you'll be like all right I messed up I've spent a lot of time working on things that never materialize into anything and I have all that scar tissue and I have some intuitions about what was useful what wasn't useful how things turned out uh so all those mistakes were uh were not dead work you know so I just think you should just focus on working what have you done what have you done last week uh that's a good question actually to ask for for a lot of things not just machine learning um it's a good way to cut the the I forgot what the term will use but the fluff the blubber whatever the uh the inefficiencies in life uh what do you love about teaching you seem to find yourself often in the like drawn to teaching you're very good at it but you're also drawn to it I mean I don't think I love teaching I love happy humans and happy humans like when I teach yes I I wouldn't say I hate teaching I tolerate teaching but it's not like the act of teaching that I like it's it's that um you know I I have some I have something I'm actually okay at it yes I'm okay at teaching and people appreciate it a lot yeah and uh so I'm just happy to try to be helpful and uh teaching itself is not like the most I mean it's really it can be really annoying frustrating I was working on a bunch of lectures just now I was reminded back to my days of 231 and just how much work it is to create some of these materials and make them good the amount of iteration and thought and you go down blind alleys and just how much you change it so creating something good um in terms of like educational value is really hard and uh it's not fun it's difficult so for people should definitely go watch your new stuff you put out there are lectures where you're actually building the thing like from like you said the coldest truth so discussing back propagation by building it by looking through and just the whole thing so how difficult is that to prepare for I think that's a really powerful way to teach how did you have to prepare for that or are you just live thinking through it I will typically do like say three takes and then I take like the the better take uh so I do multiple takes and I take some of the better takes and then I just build out a lecture that way uh sometimes I have to delete 30 minutes of content because it just went down the Nelly that I didn't like too much there's about a bunch of iteration and it probably takes me you know somewhere around 10 hours to create one hour of content to give one hour it's interesting I mean is it difficult to go back to the like the basics do you draw a lot of like wisdom from going back to the basics yeah going back to back propagation loss functions where they come from and one thing I like about teaching a lot honestly is it definitely strengthens your understanding uh so it's not a purely altruistic activity it's a way to learn if you have to explain something to someone uh you realize you have gaps in knowledge uh and so I even surprised myself in those lectures like also the result will obviously look at this and then the result doesn't look like it and I'm like okay I thought I understood this yeah but that's why it's really cool to literally code you run it in a notebook and it gives you a result and you're like oh wow and like actual numbers actual input act you know actual code yeah it's not mathematical symbols Etc the source of Truth is the code it's not slides it's just like let's build it it's beautiful you're a rare human in that sense uh what advice would you give to researchers uh trying to develop and publish idea that have a big impact in the world of AI so maybe um undergrads maybe early graduate students yep I mean I would say like they definitely have to be a little bit more strategic than I had to be as a PhD student because of the way AI is evolving it's going the way of physics where you know in physics you used to be able to do experiments on your benchtop and everything was great and you could make progress and now you have to work in like LHC or like CERN and and so AI is going in that direction as well um so there's certain kinds of things that's just not possible to do on the bench top anymore and uh I think um that didn't used to be the case at the time do you still think that there's like Gan type papers to be written where like uh like very simple idea that requires just one computer to illustrate a simple example I mean one example that's been very influential recently is diffusion models diffusion models are amazing the fusion models are six years old for the longest time people were kind of ignoring them as far as I can tell and they're an amazing generative model especially in uh in images and so stable diffusion and so on it's all diffusion based the fusion is new it was not there and came from well it came from Google but a researcher could have come up with it in fact some of the first actually no those came from Google as well but a researcher could come up with that in an academic Institution yeah what do you find Most Fascinating about diffusion models so from the societal impact to the the technical architecture what I like about the fusion is it works so well is that surprising to you the amount of the variety almost the novelty of the synthetic data is generating yeah so the stable diffusion images are incredible it's the speed of improvement in generating images has been insane uh we went very quickly from generating like tiny digits to the tiny faces and it all looked messed up and now we have stable diffusion and that happened very quickly there's a lot that Academia can still contribute you know for example um flash attention is a very efficient kernel for running the attention operation inside the Transformer that came from academic environment it's a very clever way to structure the kernel uh that that's the calculation so it doesn't materialize the attention Matrix um and so there's I think there's still like lots of things to contribute but you have to be just more strategic do you think neural networks could be made to reason uh yes do you think they're already reason yes what's your definition of reasoning uh information processing so in a way that humans think through a problem and come up with novel ideas it it feels like a reasoning yeah so the the novelty I don't want to say but out of distribution ideas you think it's possible yes and I think we're seeing that already in the current neural Nets you're able to remix the training set information into true generalization in some sense that doesn't appear it doesn't matter like you're doing something interesting algorithmically you're manipulating you know some symbols and you're coming up with some correct a unique answer in a new setting what would uh illustrate to you holy shit this thing is definitely thinking to me thinking or reasoning is just information processing and generalization and I think the neural Nets already do that today so being able to perceive the world or perceive the whatever the inputs are and to make uh predictions based on that or actions based on that that's that's the reason yeah you're giving correct answers in novel settings by manipulating information you've learned the correct algorithm you're not doing just some kind of a lookup table and there's neighbor search let me ask you about AGI what what are some moonshot ideas you think might make significant progress towards AGI or maybe in other ways what are big blockers that we're missing now so basically I am fairly bullish on our ability to build agis uh basically automated systems that we can interact with and are very human-like and we can interact with them in a digital realm or Physical Realm currently it seems most of the models that sort of do these sort of magical tasks are in a text Realm um I think uh as I mentioned I'm suspicious that the text realm is not enough to actually build full understanding of the world I do actually think you need to go into pixels and understand the physical world and how it works so I do think that we need to extend these models to consume images and videos and train on a lot more data that is multimodal in that way if you think you need to touch the world to understand it also well that's the big open question I would say in my mind is if you also require the embodiment and the ability to uh sort of interact with the world run experiments and have a data of that form then you need to go to Optimus or something like that and so I would say Optimus in some way is like a hedge in AGI because it seems to me that it's possible that just having data from the internet is not enough if that is the case then Optimus may lead to AGI because Optimus would I to me there's nothing Beyond optimism you have like this humanoid form factor that can actually like do stuff in the world you can have millions of them interacting with humans and so on and uh if that doesn't give a rise to AGI at some point like not I'm not sure what will um so from a completeness perspective I think that's the uh that's a really good platform but it's a much harder platform because uh you are dealing with atoms and you need to actually like build these things and integrate them into society so I think that path takes longer but it's much more certain and then there's a path of the internet and just like training these compression models effectively uh on uh trying to compress all the internet and that might also give these agents as well compress the internet but also interact with the internet yeah so it's not obvious to me in fact I suspect you can reach AGI without ever entering the physical world and which is a little bit more uh concerning because it might that results in it happening faster so it just feels like we're in again boiling water we won't know as it's happening I would like to I'm not afraid of AGI I'm excited about it there's always concerns but I would like to know when it happens yeah or and have like hints about when it happens like a year from now it will happen that kind of thing yeah I just feel like in the digital realm it just might happen yeah I think all we have available to us because no one has built AGI again so all we have available to us is uh is there enough for cow ground on the periphery I would say yes and we have the progress so far which has been very rapid and uh there are next steps that are available and so I would say uh yeah it's quite likely that we'll be interacting with digital entities how will you know that somebody's birthday it's going to be a slow I think it's going to be a slow incremental transition is going to be product based and focused it's going to be GitHub co-pilot getting better and then uh GPT is helping you right and then these oracles that you can go to with mathematical problems I think we're on a on the verge of being able to ask very complex questions in chemistry physics math of these oracles and have them complete Solutions so AGI to use primarily focus on intelligence so Consciousness doesn't enter into uh into it so in my mind Consciousness is not a special thing you will you will figure out and bolt-on I think it's an emerging phenomenon of a large enough and complex enough um generative model sort of so um if you have a complex and Alpha World model that understands the world then it also understands its predicament in the world as being a language model which to me is a form of Consciousness or self-awareness and so in order to understand the world deeply you probably have to integrate yourself into the world yeah and in order to interact with humans and other living beings Consciousness is a very useful tool I think Consciousness is like a modeling insight modeling Insight yeah it's a you have a powerful enough model of understanding the world that you actually understand that you are an entity in it yeah but there's also this um perhaps just a narrative we tell ourselves there's a it feels like something to experience the world the hard problem of Consciousness yeah but that could be just the narrative that we tell ourselves yeah I don't think what yeah I think it will emerge I think it's going to be something uh very boring like we'll be talking to these uh digital AIS they will claim they're conscious they will appear conscious they will do all the things that you would expect of other humans and uh it's going to just be a stalemate I I think there would be a lot of actual fascinating ethical questions like Supreme Court level questions of whether you're allowed to turn off a conscious AI if you're allowed to build the conscious AI maybe there would have to be the same kind of debates that you have around um sorry to bring up a political topic but you know abortion which is the deeper question with abortion is what is life and the Deep question with AI is also what is life and what is conscious and I think that'll be very fascinating to bring up it might become illegal to build systems that are capable that like of such a level of intelligence that Consciousness would emerge and therefore the capacity to suffer would emerge and some A system that says no please don't kill me well that's what the Lambda compute the Lambda chatbot already told um this Google engineer right like it it was talking about not wanting to die or so on so that might become illegal to do that right I because otherwise you might have a lot of a lot of creatures that don't want to die and they will uh you can just spawn Infinity of them on a cluster and then that might lead to like horrible consequences because then there might be a lot of people that secretly love murder and they'll start practicing murder on those systems I mean there's just I to me all of this stuff just brings a beautiful mirror to The Human Condition and human nature we'll get to explore it and that's what like the best of uh the Supreme Court of all the different debates we have about ideas of what it means to be human we get to ask those deep questions that we've been asking throughout human history there's always been the other in human history uh we're the good guys and that's the bad guys and we're going to uh you know throughout human history let's murder the bad guys and the same will probably happen with robots it'll be the other at first and then we'll get to ask questions of what does it mean to be alive what does it mean to be conscious yeah and I think there's some Canary in the coal mines even with what we have today um and uh you know for example these there's these like waifus that you like work with and some people are trying to like this company is going to shut down but this person really like yeah love their waifu and like is trying to like Port it somewhere else and like it's not possible and like I think like definitely uh people will have feelings towards uh towards these um systems because in some sense they are like a mirror of humanity because they are like sort of like a big average of humanity yeah in a way that it's trained but we can that average we can actually watch it's nice to be able to interact with the big average of humanity yeah and do like a search query on it yeah yeah it's very fascinating and uh we can also of course also like shape it it's not just a pure average we can mess with the training data we can mess with the objective we can fine tune them in various ways so we have some um you know impact on what those systems look like if you want to achieve AGI um and you could have a conversation with her and ask her uh talk about anything maybe ask her a question what kind of stuff would you would you ask I would have some practical questions in my mind like uh do I or my loved ones really have to die uh what can we do about that do you think it will answer clearly or would it answer poetically I would expect it to give Solutions I would expect it to be like well I've read all of these textbooks and I know all these things that you've produced and it seems to me like here are the experiments that I think it would be useful to run next and hear some Gene therapies that I think would be helpful and uh here are the kinds of experiments that you should run okay let's go over the Start experiment okay imagine that mortality is actually uh like a prerequisite for happiness so if we become immortal we'll actually become deeply unhappy and the model is able to know that so what is this supposed to tell you stupid human about it yes you can become a mortal but you will become deeply unhappy if if the model is if the AGI system is trying to empathize with you human what is this supposed to tell you that yes you don't have to die but you're really not going to like it because that is it going to be deeply honest like there's a Interstellar what is it the AI says like humans want 90 honesty so like you have to pick how honest I want to answer these practical questions yeah I love Yeah Interstellar by the way I think it's like such a sidekick to the entire story but at the same time it's like really interesting it's kind of limited in certain ways right yeah it's limited and I think that's totally fine by the way I don't think uh I think it's find impossible to have a limited and imperfect agis is that the feature almost as an example like it has a fixed amount of compute on its physical body and it might just be that even though you can have a super amazing Mega brain super intelligent AI you also can have like you know less intelligent AIS that you can deploy in a power efficient way and then they're not perfect they might make mistakes no I meant more like say you had infinite compute and it's still good to make mistakes sometimes like in order to integrate yourself like um what is it going back to Goodwill Hunting uh Robin Williams character says like the human imperfections that's the good stuff right isn't it isn't that this like we don't want perfect we want flaws in part to form connections with each other because it feels like something you can attach your feelings to the the flaws in that same way you want an AI That's flawed I don't know I feel like perfectionist but then you're saying okay yeah but that's not AGI but see AGI would need to be intelligent enough to give answers to humans that humans don't understand and I think perfect isn't something humans can't understand because even science doesn't give perfect answers there's always gabs and Mysteries and I don't know I I don't know if humans want perfect yeah I could imagine just uh having a conversation with this kind of Oracle entity as you'd imagine them and uh yeah maybe it can tell you about you know based on my analysis of Human Condition uh you might not want this and here are some of the things that might but every every dumb human will say yeah yeah trust me I can give me the truth I can handle it but that's the beauty a lot of people can choose uh so but then the old marshmallow test with the kids and so on I feel like too many people uh like it can't handle the truth probably including myself like the Deep truth of The Human Condition I don't I don't know if I can handle it like what if there's some dark stuff what if we are an alien science experiment and it realizes that what if it had I mean I mean this is the Matrix you know the middle over again I don't know I would what would I talk about I don't even yeah I uh probably I will go with the save for scientific questions at first that have nothing to do with my own personal life yeah immortality just like about physics and so on yeah uh to build up like let's see where it's at or maybe see if it has a sense of humor that's another question would it be able to uh presumably in order to if it understands humans deeply would able to generate uh yep to generate humor yeah I think that's actually a wonderful Benchmark almost like is it able I think that's a really good point basically to make you laugh yeah if it's able to be like a very effective stand-up comedian that is doing something very interesting computationally I think being funny is extremely hard yeah because it's hard in a way like a touring test the original intent of the touring test is hard because you have to convince humans and there's nothing that's why that's why when comedians talk about this like there's this is deeply honest because if people can't help but laugh and if they don't laugh that means you're not funny they laugh that's funny and you're showing you need a lot of knowledge to create to create humor about like the occupational Human Condition and so on and then you need to be clever with it uh you mentioned a few movies you tweeted movies that I've seen five plus times but I'm ready and willing to keep watching Interstellar Gladiator contact Goodwill Hunting The Matrix Lord of the Rings all three Avatar Fifth Element so on goes on Terminator two Mean Girls I'm not gonna ask about that mean girls is great um what are some of the jump onto your memory that you love and why like you mentioned the Matrix as a computer person why do you love The Matrix there's so many properties that make it like beautiful and interesting so there's all these philosophical questions but then there's also agis and there's simulation and it's cool and there's you know the black uh you know uh the look of it the feel of it the look of it the feel of it the action the bullet time it was just like innovating in so many ways and then uh Good Good Will Hunting why do you like that one yeah I just I really like this uh torture genius sort of character who's like grappling with whether or not he has like any responsibility or like what to do with this gift that he was given or like how to think about the whole thing and uh there's also a dance between the genius and the the personal like what it means to love another human being and there's a lot of themes there it's just a beautiful movie and then the fatherly figure The Mentor in the in the psychiatrist and the it like really like uh it messes with you you know there's some movies that's just like really mess with you uh on a deep level do you relate to that movie at all no it's not your fault doctor as I said Lord of the Rings that's self-explanatory Terminator 2 which is interesting you we watch that a lot is that better than Terminator one you like you like Arnold I do like Terminator one as well uh I like Terminator 2 a little bit more but in terms of like its surface properties [Laughter] do you think Skynet is at all a possibility oh yes well like the actual sort of uh autonomous uh weapon system kind of thing do you worry about that uh stuff I 100 worry about it and so the I mean the uh you know some of these uh fears of AGS and how this will plan out I mean these will be like very powerful entities probably at some point and so um for a long time they're going to be tools in the hands of humans uh you know people talk about like alignment of agis and how to make the problem is like even humans are not aligned uh so uh how this will be used and what this is going to look like is um yeah it's troubling so do you think it'll happen so slowly enough that we'll be able to as a human civilization think through the problems yes that's my hope is that it happens slowly enough and in an open enough way where a lot of people can see and participate in it just figure out how to deal with this transition I think which is going to be interesting I draw a lot of inspiration from nuclear weapons because I sure thought it would be it would be fucked once they develop nuclear weapons but like it's almost like uh when the when the systems are not so dangerous they destroy human civilization we deploy them and learn the lessons and then we quickly if it's too dangerous we're quickly quicker we might still deploy it uh but you very quickly learn not to use them and so there'll be like this balance that you humans are very clever as a species it's interesting we exploit the resources as much as we can but we don't we avoid destroying ourselves it seems like well I don't know about that actually I hope it continues um I mean I'm definitely like concerned about nuclear weapons and so on not just as a result of the recent conflict even before that uh that's probably like my number one concern for society so if Humanity uh destroys itself or destroys you know 90 of people that would be because of nukes I think so um and it's not even about full destruction to me it's bad enough if we reset society that would be like terrible it would be really bad and I can't believe we're like so close to it yeah it's like so crazy to me it feels like we might be a few tweets away from something like that yep basically it's extremely unnerving but and has been for me for a long time it seems unstable that world leaders just having a bad mood can like um take one step towards a bad Direction and it escalates yeah and because of a collection of bad moods it can escalate without being able to um stop yeah it's just it's a huge amount of uh Power and then also with the proliferation and basically I don't I don't actually really see I don't actually know what the good outcomes are here uh so I'm definitely worried about that a lot and then AGI is not currently there but I think at some point we'll more and more become uh something like it the danger with AGI even is that I think it's even less likely worse in a sense that uh there are good outcomes of AGI and then the bad outcomes are like an absolute way like a tiny one way and so I think um capitalism and humanity and so on will drive for the positive uh ways of using that technology but then if bad outcomes are just like a tiny like flipping minus sign away uh that's a really bad position to be in a tiny perturbation of the system results in the destruction of the human species it's a weird line to walk yeah I think in general what's really weird about like the Dynamics of humanity and this explosion was talked about is just like the insane coupling afforded by technology yeah and uh just the instability of the whole dynamical system I think it's just it doesn't look good honestly yes that explosion could be destructive and constructive and the probabilities are non-zero in both both senses I'm going to have to I do feel like I have to try to be optimistic and so on and yes I think even in this case I still am predominantly optimistic but there's definitely me too uh do you think we'll become a multiplayer species probably yes but I don't know if it's dominant feature of uh future Humanity uh there might be some people on some planets and so on but I'm not sure if it's like yeah if it's like a major player in our culture and so on we still have to solve the drivers of self-destruction here on Earth so just having a backup on Mars is not going to solve the problem so by the way I love the backup on Mars I think that's amazing you should absolutely do that yes and I'm so thankful uh and would you go to Mars uh personally no I do like Earth quite a lot okay uh I'll go to Mars I'll go for you unless I'll tweet at you from there maybe eventually I would once it's uh safe enough but I don't actually know if it's on my lifetime scale unless I can extend it by a lot I do think that for example a lot of people might disappear into um virtual realities and stuff like that and I think that could be the major thrust of um sort of the cultural development of humanity if it survives uh so it might not be it's just really hard to work in Physical Realm and go out there and I think ultimately all your experiences are in your brain yeah and so it's much easier to disappear into digital Realm and I think people will find them more compelling easier safer more interesting so you're a little bit captivated by Virtual Reality by the possible worlds whether it's the metaverse or some other manifestation of that yeah yeah it's really interesting it's uh I'm I'm interested just just talking a lot to Carmack where's the where's the thing that's currently preventing that yeah I mean to be clear I think what's interesting about the future is um it's not that I kind of feel like the variance in The Human Condition grows that's the primary thing that's changing it's not as much the mean of the distribution it's like the variance of it so there will probably be people on Mars and there will be people in VR and they're all people here on Earth it's just like there will be so many more ways of being and so I kind of feel like I see it as like a spreading out of a human experience there's something about the internet that allows you to discover those little groups and you you gravitate each other something about your biology likes that kind of world and that you find each other yeah and we'll have transhumanists and then we'll have the Amish and they're gonna everything is just gonna coexist you know the cool thing about it because I've interacted with a bunch of Internet communities is um they don't know about each other like you can have a very happy existence just like having a very close-knit community and not knowing about each other I mean even even since this just having traveled to Ukraine there's they they don't know so many things about America you you like when you travel across the world I think you experience this too there are certain cultures they're like they have their own thing going on they don't and so you can see that happening more and more and more and more in the future we have little communities yeah yeah I think so that seems to be the that seems to be how it's going right now and I don't see that Trend like really reversing I think people are diverse and they're able to choose their own like path and existence and I sort of like celebrate that um and so will you spend so much time in the meters in the virtual reality or which Community are you are you the physicalist uh the the the physical reality enjoyer or uh do you see drawing a lot of uh pleasure and fulfillment in the digital world yeah I think well currently the virtual reality is not that compelling I do think it can improve a lot but I don't really know to what extent maybe you know there's actually like even more exotic things you can think about with like neural links or stuff like that so um currently I kind of see myself as mostly a team human person I love nature yeah I love Harmony I love people I love Humanity I love emotions of humanity um and I I just want to be like in this like solar Punk little Utopia that's my happy place yeah my happy place is like uh people I love thinking about cool problems surrounded by a lush beautiful Dynamic nature yeah yeah and secretly high tech in places that count places like they use technology to empower that love for other humans and nature yeah I think a technology used like very sparingly uh I don't love when it sort of gets in the way of humanity in many ways uh I like just people being humans in a way we sort of like slightly evolved and prefer I think just by default people kept asking me because they they know you love reading are there particular books that you enjoyed that had an impact on you for silly or for profound reasons that you would recommend you mentioned the vital question many of course I think in biology as an example the vital question is a good one anything by McLean really uh life ascending I would say is like a bit more potentially uh representative as like a summary of a lot of the things he's been talking about I was very impacted by the selfish Gene I thought that was a really good book that helped me understand altruism as an example and where it comes from and just realizing that you know the selection is in the level of genes was a huge insight for me at the time and it sort of like cleared up a lot of things for me what do you think about the the idea that ideas of the organisms the means yes love it 100 [Laughter] are you able to walk around with that notion for a while that that there is an evolutionary kind of process with ideas as well there absolutely is there's memes just like genes and they compete and they live in our brains it's beautiful are we silly humans thinking that we're the organisms is it possible that the primary organisms are the ideas yeah I would say like the the ideas kind of live in the software of like our civilization in the in the minds and so on we think as humans that the hardware is the fundamental thing I human is a hardware entity yeah but it could be the software right yeah yeah I would say like there needs to be some grounding at some point to like a physical reality yeah but if we clone an Andre the software is the thing like is this thing that makes that thing special right yeah I guess I you're right but then cloning might be exceptionally difficult like there might be a deep integration between the software and the hardware in ways we don't quite understand well from the evolution point of view like what makes me special is more like the the gang of genes that are writing in my chromosomes I suppose right like they're the they're the replicating unit I suppose and no but that's just for you the thing that makes you special sure wow the reality is what makes you special is your ability to survive based on the software that runs on the hardware that was built by the genes um so the software is the thing that makes you survive not the hardware all right yeah it's just like a second layer it's a new second layer that hasn't been there before the brain they both they both coexist but there's also layers of the software I mean it's it's not it's a it's a abstraction that's uh on top of abstractions but okay so selfish Gene um a neckline I would say sometimes books are like not sufficient I like to reach for textbooks sometimes um I kind of feel like books are for too much of a general consumption sometime and they just kind of like uh they're too high up in the level of abstraction and it's not good enough yeah so I like textbooks I like the cell I think the cell was pretty cool uh that's why also I like the writing of uh McLean is because he's pretty willing to step one level down and he doesn't uh yeah he's sort of he's willing to go there but he's also willing to sort of be throughout the stack so he'll go down to a lot of detail but then he will come back up and I think he has a yeah basically I really appreciate that that's why I love college early college even high school but just textbooks on the basics yeah of Computer Science and Mathematics of of biology of chemistry yes those are they condense down like uh uh it's sufficiently General that you can understand the both the philosophy and the details but also like you get homework problems and you you get to play with it as much as you would if you weren't yeah programming stuff yeah and then I'm also suspicious of textbooks honestly because as an example in deep learning uh there's no like amazing textbooks and I feel this changing very quickly I imagine the same is true and say uh synthetic biology and so on these books like this cell are kind of outdated they're still high level like what is the actual real source of truth it's people in wet Labs working with cells yeah you know sequencing genomes and yeah actually working with working with it and uh I don't have that much exposure to that or what that looks like so I sold them fully I'm reading through the cell and it's kind of interesting and I'm learning but it's still not sufficient I would say in terms of understanding well it's a clean summarization of the mainstream narrative yeah but you have to learn that before you break out yeah towards The Cutting Edge yeah what is the actual process of working with these cells and growing them and incubating them and you know it's kind of like a massive cooking recipe so making sure your self slows and proliferate and then you're sequencing them running experiments and uh just how that works I think is kind of like the source of truth of at the end of the day what's really useful in terms of creating therapies and so on yeah I wonder in the future AI textbooks will be because you know there's a artificial intelligence a modern approach I actually haven't read if it's come out the recent version the recent there's been a recent Edition I also saw there's a science a deep learning book I'm waiting for textbooks that worth recommending worth reading it's It's tricky because it's like papers and code code honestly papers are quite good I especially like the appendix appendix of any paper as well it's like it's like the most detail it can have it doesn't have to be cohesive to connected to anything else you just describe me a very specific way you solved a particular thing yeah many times papers can be actually quite readable not always but sometimes the introduction in the abstract is readable even for someone outside of the field uh not this is not always true and sometimes I think unfortunately scientists use complex terms even when it's not necessary I think that's harmful I think there there's no reason for that and papers sometimes are longer than they need to be in this in the parts that don't matter yeah appendix would be long but then the paper itself you know look at Einstein make it simple yeah but certainly I've come across papers I would say in say like synthetic biology or something that I thought were quite readable for the abstract and the introduction and then you're reading the rest of it and you don't fully understand but you kind of are getting a gist and I think it's cool what uh advice you give advice to folks interested in machine learning and research but in General Life advice to a young person High School um Early College about how to have a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of yeah I think I'm very hesitant to give general advice I think it's really hard I've mentioned like some of the stuff I've mentioned is fairly General I think like focus on just the amount of work you're spending on like a thing uh compare yourself only to yourself not to others that's good I think those are fairly General how do you pick the thing uh you just have like a deep interest in something uh or like try to like find the art Max over like the things that you're interested in ARG Max at that moment and stick with it how do you not get distracted and switch to another thing uh you can if you like um well if you do an ARG Max repeatedly every week it doesn't converge it doesn't it's a problem yeah you can like low pass filter yourself uh in terms of like what has consistently been true for you um but yeah I definitely see how it can be hard but I would say like you're going to work the hardest on the thing that you care about the most also a low pass filter yourself and really introspect in your past were the things that gave you energy and what are the things that took energy away from you concrete examples and usually uh from those concrete examples sometimes patterns can merge I like I like it when things look like this when I'm these positions so that's not necessarily the field but the kind of stuff you're doing in a particular field so for you it seems like you were energized by implementing stuff building actual things yeah being low level learning and then also uh communicating so that others can go through the same realizations and shortening that Gap um because I usually have to do way too much work to understand the thing and then I'm like okay this is actually like okay I think I get it and like why was it so much work it should have been much less work and that gives me a lot of frustration and that's why I sometimes go teach so aside from the teaching you're doing now uh putting out videos aside from a potential uh Godfather part two uh with the AGI at Tesla and Beyond uh what does the future for Android kapati hold have you figured that out yet or no I mean uh as you see through the fog of war that is all of our future um do you do you start seeing silhouettes of the what that possible future could look like the consistent thing I've been always interested in for me at least is is AI and um uh that's probably where I'm spending my rest of my life on because I just care about a lot and I actually care about like many other problems as well like say aging which I basically view as disease and uh um I care about that as well but I don't think it's a good idea to go after it specifically I don't actually think that humans will be able to come up with the answer I think the correct thing to do is to ignore those problems and you solve Ai and then use that to solve everything else and I think there's a chance that this will work I think it's a very high chance and uh that's kind of like the the way I'm betting at least so when you think about AI are you interested in all kinds of applications all kinds of domains and any domain you focus on will allow you to get insights to the big problem of AGI yeah for me it's the ultimate mental problem I don't want to work on any one specific problem there's too many problems so how can you work on all problems simultaneously you solve The Meta problem which to me is just intelligence and how do you automate it is there cool small projects like archive sanity and and so on that you're thinking about the the the the world the ml world can anticipate there's some always like some fun side projects yeah um archive sanity is one basically like there's way too many archive papers how can I organize it and recommend papers and so on uh I transcribed all of your yeah podcasts what did you learn from that experience uh from transcribing the process of like you like consuming audiobooks and and podcasts and so on and here's the process that achieves um closer to human level performance and annotation yeah well I definitely was like surprised that uh transcription with opening eyes whisper was working so well compared to what I'm familiar with from Siri and like a few other systems I guess it works so well and uh that's what gave me some energy to like try it out and I thought it could be fun to random podcasts it's kind of not obvious to me why whisper is so much better compared to anything else because I feel like there should be a lot of incentive for a lot of companies to produce transcription systems and that they've done so over a long time whisper is not a super exotic model it's a Transformer it takes smell spectrograms and you know just outputs tokens of text it's not crazy uh the model and everything has been around for a long time I'm not actually 100 sure why yeah it's not obvious to me either it makes me feel like I'm missing something I'm missing something yeah because there's a huge even at Google and so on YouTube uh transcription yeah um yeah it's unclear but some of it is also integrating into a bigger system yeah that so the user interface how it's deployed and all that kind of stuff maybe running it as an independent thing is eat much easier like an order of magnitude easier than deploying to a large integrated system like YouTube transcription or um anything like meetings like Zoom has trans transcription that's kind of crappy but creating uh interface where it detects the different individual speakers it's able to um display it in compelling ways Run in real time all that kind of stuff maybe that's difficult but that's the only explanation I have because like um I'm currently paying uh quite a bit for human uh transcription human caption right annotation and like it seems like uh there's a huge incentive to automate that yeah it's very confusing and I think I mean I don't know if you looked at some of the whisper transcripts but they're quite good they're good and especially in tricky cases yeah I've seen uh Whispers performance on like super tricky cases and it does incredibly well so I don't know a podcast is pretty simple it's like high quality audio and you're speaking usually pretty clearly and so I don't know it uh I don't know what open ai's plans are yeah either but yeah there's always like fun fun projects basically and stable diffusion also is opening up a huge amount of experimentation I would say in the visual realm and generate generating images and videos and movies videos now and so that's going to be pretty crazy uh that's going to that's going to almost certainly work and it's going to be really interesting when the cost of content creation is going to fall to zero you used to need a painter for a few months to paint a thing and now it's going to be speak to your phone to get your video so if Hollywood will start using that to generate scene means which completely opens up yeah so you can make a like a movie like Avatar eventually for under a million dollars much less maybe just by talking to your phone I mean I know it sounds kind of crazy and then there'd be some voting mechanism like how do you have a like would there be a show on Netflix that's generated completely uh automatedly potentially yeah and what does it look like also when you can just generate It On Demand and it's uh and there's Infinity of it yeah oh man all the synthetic content I mean it's humbling because we we treat ourselves as special for being able to generate art and ideas and all that kind of stuff if that can be done in an automated Way by AI yeah I think it's fascinating to me how these uh the predictions of AI and what it's going to look like and what it's going to be capable of are completely inverted and wrong and the Sci-Fi of 50s and 60s was just like totally not bright they imagined AI is like super calculating theore improvers and we're getting things that can talk to you about emotions they can do art it's just like weird are you excited about that feature just ai's like hybrid systems heterogeneous systems of humans and AIS talking about emotions Netflix and chill with an AI system legit where the Netflix thing you watch is also generated by AI I think it's uh it's going to be interesting for sure and I think I'm cautiously optimistic but it's not it's not obvious well the sad thing is your brain and mine developed in a time where um before Twitter before the before the internet so I wonder people that are born inside of it might have a different experience um like I maybe you can will still resist it uh and the people born now will not well I do feel like humans are extremely malleable yeah and uh you're probably right what is the meaning of life Andre we we talked about sort of the universe having a conversation with us humans or with the systems we create to try to answer for the university for the creator of the universe to notice us we're trying to create systems that are loud enough just answer back I don't know if that's the meaning of life that's like meaning of life for some people the first level answer I would say is anyone can choose their own meaning of life because we are conscious entity and it's beautiful number one but uh I do think that like a deeper meaning of life if someone is interested is uh or along the lines of like what the hell is All This and like why and if you look at the into fundamental physics and the quantum field Theory and a standard model they're like very complicated and um there's this like you know 19 free parameter parameters of our universe and like what's going on with all this stuff and why is it here and can I hack it can I work with it is there a message for me am I supposed to create a message and so I think there's some fundamental answers there but I think there's actually even like you can't actually really make dent in those without more time and so to me also there's a big question around just getting more time honestly yeah that's kind of like what I think about quite a bit as well so kind of the ultimate or at least first way to sneak up to the why question is to try to escape uh the system the universe yeah and then for that you sort of uh backtrack and say okay for that that's going to be take a very long time so the why question boils down from an engineering perspective to how do we extend yeah I think that's the question number one practically speaking because you can't uh you're not gonna calculate the answer to the deeper questions in the time you have and that could be extending your own lifetime or extending just the lifetime of human civilization of whoever wants to not many people might not want that but I think people who do want that I think um I think it's probably possible uh and I don't I don't know that people fully realize this I kind of feel like people think of death as an inevitability but at the end of the day this is a physical system some things go wrong uh it makes sense why things like this happen evolutionarily speaking and uh there's most certainly interventions that uh that mitigate it that would be interesting if death is eventually looked at as as a fascinating thing that used to happen to humans I don't think it's unlikely I think it's I think it's likely and it's up to our imagination to try to predict what the world without death looks like yeah it's hard to I think the values will completely change could be I don't I don't really buy all these ideas that oh without that there's no meaning there's nothing as I don't intuitively buy all those arguments I think there's plenty of meaning plenty of things to learn they're interesting exciting I want to know I want to calculate uh I want to improve the condition of all the humans and organisms that are alive yet the way we find meaning might change we there is a lot of humans probably including myself that finds meaning in the finiteness of things but that doesn't mean that's the only source of meaning yeah I do think many people will will go with that which I think is great I love the idea that people can just choose their own adventure like you you are born as a conscious free entity by default I'd like to think and um you have your unalienable rights for Life uh in the pursuit of happiness I don't know if you have that in the nature the landscape of happiness you can choose your own adventure mostly and that's not it's not fully true but I still am pretty sure I'm an NPC but um an NPC can't know it's an NPC there could be different degrees and levels of consciousness I don't think there's a more beautiful way to end it uh Andre you're an incredible person I'm really honored you would talk with me everything you've done for the machine learning world for the AI world to just inspire people to educate millions of people it's been it's been great and I can't wait to see what you do next it's been an honor man thank you so much for talking today awesome thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with Andre karapathi to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Samuel Carlin the purpose of models is not to fit the data but to sharpen the questions thanks for listening and hope to see you next time\""
